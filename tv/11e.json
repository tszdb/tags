How can we ensure this right to every child? Discuss the role of the government and the parents to make sure that every child can attend school.’</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans: To ensure every child's right to quality education:</p><p>Governments must make primary and secondary education free and compulsory by law for all children. They need to adequately fund schools and vocational training institutions.</p><p>Governments and schools must work to minimize costs like textbooks, uniforms etc to improve accessibility for poor families.</p><p>Parents need to realize the importance of education.

It means that by investing in the education of children, we are planting the seeds for a better future. </p><p><br /></p><p><span color=\"var(--tw-prose-bold)\">Planting Rice (1 year)</span> refers to immediate needs. If you focus on short-term goals, like planting rice, you'll have food for the present but not much for the future. <span color=\"var(--tw-prose-bold)\">Planting Trees (10 years) means that t</span>rees take longer to grow but provide fruits, wood, and shade. <span color=\"var(--tw-prose-bold)\">Educating Children</span> has a profound and lasting impact on society.

Write in three paragraphs of an event that you always remember. </strong></p><p>One event from my school days that I will always remember is our annual sports day celebration.

After the events ended, we would come together to sing the school anthem and hear the principal's speech before snacks were distributed. It was a fun day of building school spirit and camaraderie through sports.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>2.\"Education empowers a person\". Elaborate this statement giving examples of your personal experience.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Education gives you knowledge and skills. I learned new things that helped me think on my own.

She looked very …… (calm/calmly), but I am sure she was feeling very nervous.</p><p>→ calm</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Comprehension</strong></p><p>Answer the following questions.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>a. Why is freewriting also called ‘automatic writing’?</strong></p><p>→ Freewriting is also called 'automatic writing’ because it is performed without any conscious control to achieve a spontaneous expression and without worrying about Grammar or coherency.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. How do you differentiate writing from speaking?</strong></p><p>→ Writing is more flexible as we can edit or make it good by imposing our writing skills, but editing is not possible in speaking as we do real -time expression in speaking.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What is the biggest obstacle in the writing process, according to Elbow?&nbsp;Do you agree with him? Why? Why not?</strong></p><p><strong>→&nbsp;</strong>The biggest obstacles in the writing process or the thoughts like what to write?,&nbsp;contemplation of wrong grammar and worrying about right- editing are those obstacles according to Elbow. If a writer starts caring about his grammar, coherence and editing from the initial phase, he can't learn free writing properly.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. How can freewriting overcome ‘writer’s block’?</strong></p><p>→ Freewriting can overcome ‘writer’s block’ as it is non - editing. Free writing allows the writer to write whatever they want with no limitations. As a result, free-writing overcomes blockades.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. What do you mean by ‘voice’ in writing?</strong></p><p>→ Vocabulary and writing style like sound, texture, and rhythm are considered as voices in writing.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. Elbow uses a simile to explain that freewriting “is like writing something and putting it in a bottle in the sea.” What does this mean?</strong>&nbsp;Explain.</p><p>→ Elbow uses a simile to explain that freewriting is like writing something and keeping it in a bottle in the sea.</p><p>If we put something in a bottle and put it in the sea, nobody will go to sea again, search that bottle and see what is inside. Similarly, we write something in our copy and leave that it won't be examined by anybody else. Freewriting helps somebody by providing no feedback.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Critical thinking</strong></p><p><strong>a. How does the author persuade readers in this essay?</strong>&nbsp;<strong>What is he trying to communicate to the readers?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>The author explains that freewriting helps writers by letting them write without stopping to edit. This allows words and ideas to flow freely. Editing too much can block writing. The author says freewriting reveals a writer's real voice. He stresses how important it is to let writing happen naturally without stopping to express your thoughts in a real style.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Elbow said, freewriting “is an exercise in bringing together the process of producing words and putting them down on the page.” Do you agree with his statement?&nbsp;Why? Why not?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;I agree with the statement that freewriting means putting words on paper without stopping. It helps us to express our ideas and feelings without self-criticism. This can be a good way to write. This can be helpful to access and express ideas and emotions without the inhibitions of self-critique and editing.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. How did you learn to write? What was particularly difficult in writing? What inspired you to write? What are some of the challenges that you still face while writing?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;I learned to write through school, practicing a lot, and reading many books. Writing was hard for me to organize thoughts clearly and develop my own style. What motivated me to write was wanting to share ideas, stories, and views with others.</p><p><br /></p><p>Some challenges I still face are doubting myself, editing too soon, and finding the right balance between being creative and clear. Writing continues to be a journey of always improving and learning about myself.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>B. Read the following paragraph. Identify the topic sentence and the concluding sentence.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>The topic sentence of the paragraph is: \"Students require more recreational time in order to better focus on lessons in class.\"</p><p><br /></p><p>The concluding sentence of the paragraph is: \"Clearly, physical exercise is just one of the necessary ingredients for improving student scores on standardized tests.\"</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>C. Write a paragraph on any one of the following topics.</strong></p><p><strong>a. My school library</strong></p><p><strong>b. Moral values I like most</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>My school library</p><p><br /></p><p>My school library is a wonderful place.

It helps people connect and share information with others, even if they are far away. It can also raise awareness about important issues and promote social causes.

Answer these questions.</strong></p><p><strong>a. Why is the Zhou Age called a feudal age?</strong></p><p>→ The Zhou Age is called feudal because it was similar to feudalism in medieval Europe. China had city-states loyal to the Zhou king, and they controlled the surrounding farming villages.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. What is the location advantage of the Qin?</strong></p><p>→ The Qin had a good location advantage. They were protected by mountains and had easy access to the North China plain through the Yellow River passes. This made it hard for battles to happen in their main territory.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What contributed to the success in the warfare as described in the text?</strong></p><p>→ The Qin Dynasty succeeded in warfare due to factors like their favorable location, vast resources, large army, skilled use of chariots, and their ruthlessness in battle.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Why did the Qin invite the foreign advisor, Shang Yang?</strong></p><p>→ The Qin invited the foreign advisor, Shang Yang, because they did not have any skilled intellectuals and politicians within their own borders. Shang Yang was a talented person who could help the Qin government become more successful.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. What were the key features of the Qin political system?</strong></p><p>→ The Qin's political system was based on fear and control. People were responsible for each other's behavior, and not reporting violations had severe consequences. Those who contributed were rewarded, while those seen as unimportant became slaves.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. How were the people treated during the Qin Period?</strong></p><p>→ People were supposed to contribute to the nation. Otherwise they were made slaves to work on Huangdi's building projects like The Great Wall of China, the great canal etc. Most of the people were deprived from the approach of education.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>g. Why did Shi Huangdi stop educating ordinary people?</strong></p><p>→ Shi Huangdi stopped educating ordinary people because he believed that an uneducated population was easier to control. He wanted people to remain ignorant so they would not question the authority of the empire.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>h. What did the Qin achieve by legalism in practice?</strong></p><p>→ Legislalism in practise helped the Qin build a powerful state with an excellent army, a well-organized bureaucracy, loyal servants, and the undisputed authority of a powerful central government.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>i. Why did Shi Huangdi never sleep in the same room for two consecutive nights?</strong></p><p>→ Shi Huangdi never slept in same room and kept changing sleeping locations to protect himself from potential threats.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>j. What are the everlasting marks of the Qin Dynasty?</strong></p><p>→ The Qin Dynasty left everlasting marks like a bureaucratic government, the Terracotta Army, the early Great Wall of China, the Grand Canal, and roads connecting cities and countryside. It greatly influenced Chinese history, government, and infrastructure.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Critical thinking</strong></p><p><strong>a. The Great Wall and the Taj Mahal are the creation of the autocratic rulers. Present your view for or against this statement.</strong></p><p>The statement is partly true. It is correct that the rulers had the power to start very big projects like the Great Wall and Taj Mahal. As powerful kings/emperors, they could use all resources of the country and order many workers. However, it was not just because of their power alone. Ordinary workers, engineers and artists also contributed through their skills and hard work. The projects also showed the economic strength and culture of those societies. So while the rulers initiated them, it was a combined effort of the rulers and people.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. How do you describe the pros and cons of feudalism?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Feudalism provided security. Lords protected people from invaders and criminals in exchange for their loyalty and labor. This provided stability. Everyone had a clearly defined role and place in society. People knew what was expected of them. Feudalism distributed land among the lords, who then allocated it to peasants. This helped organize agriculture.</p><p><br /></p><p>Major cons of feudalism is no freedom. People were tied to their lord's land and had to obey them without question. They had little to no individual freedom. People had to pay heavy taxes to the lord in forms of labor, crops or money. This was financially burdensome. The social status of a person was fixed based on their parentage. It was very difficult to improve the social status. </p><p><br /></p><p>In summary, feudalism provided security and order but took away individual freedoms and mobility. The duties on people were also unjust and taxation was very high. There were both benefits and disadvantages associated with the feudal system.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>a.Write an email to your friend living abroad stating the contributions of Prithvi Narayan Shah in the unification of Nepal.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Subject: Prithvi Narayan Shah - Unifier of Nepal</p><p><br /></p><p>Hey Ram,</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope you're doing well abroad.

Why was the doctor not ready to go to see her husband?</strong></p><p>→ After treating typhus patients for the past three days, the doctor was tired and sick. So, he did not go to visit her husband.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. Why did Stepan Lukitch suggest Nellie go to the Zemstvo doctor?</strong></p><p>→ He was tired and exhausted and had almost fallen ill due to his work for the previous 3-days, so he suggested Nellie go to the zemstvo doctor, because of his inability.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>g. Nellie said, “Come, perform that heroic deed! Have pity on us!\" What was that pity to be done?</strong></p><p>→ The pity which was to be done by the doctor was that he had to treat Nellie’s husband.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>h.

It means that all she saw was nothing but a daydream or imagination.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>i. What is the main theme of the story?</strong></p><p>→ The main theme of the story is loneliness, imagination, fear, suspense, love, responsibilities etc. It informs us that we must depend on realities, sometimes, imagination can also bring harshness in real life. We should have enough courage to face them in practical life as well.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Critical thinking</strong></p><p><strong>a. “The looking glass (mirror)” is used as a symbol in the story. What does it symbolise?</strong></p><p>The looking glass (mirror) in the story can be seen as a symbol of self-reflection and the passage of time. Nellie gazes into the mirror, and it becomes a portal to her daydreams and desires. It reflects her dreams and hopes, especially her longing for love and marriage. However, the mirror also serves as a reminder of the fleeting nature of these dreams and the passage of time. As she looks into it, her visions become clouded and merge into a boundless grey sea, symbolizing the uncertainty and impermanence of life. In the end, when Nellie wakes up and sees her tear-stained face in the mirror, it symbolizes her return to reality and the realization that her dreams may remain unfulfilled. So, the mirror serves as a symbol of both longing and the harsh reality of life.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b.

Specific hormones regulate our appetite.</p><p>→ True</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>B. Answer the following questions.</strong></p><p><strong>a. In what sense are the holidays a time of excess?&nbsp;When can a person gain weight?</strong></p><p>→ People overeat over the holidays, having more food and alcohol than normal. When someone overeats and underexercises, it's possible to put on weight.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. According to David Allison, which factor contributes to excess obesity?</strong></p><p>→ Light exposure (time spent in bright or dark settings), viruses (infection with adenovirus-36) and epigenetics (genetic changes brought on by various environmental signals) all contribute to obesity, according to David Allison.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What, according to Dhurandhar, can be the way of preventing fatness?</strong></p><p>→ Dhurandhar claims that immunisation against diseases is a good method to avoid becoming fat.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. What is the relationship between chill and obesity?&nbsp;How can saying ‘om’ help reduce fatness?</strong></p><p>→ High stress is linked to increased cortisol and fat storage in body. Relaxation through mediation like saying 'om' lowers cortisol and supports a healthier metabolism, which can help reduce obesity. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. Why is it necessary to be careful while buying plastic packaged fatty foods?</strong></p><p>→ We must be careful when buying foods with fat in plastic bags. The plastic can sometimes hold chemicals that harm hormones. These chemicals are called \"endocrine disruptors\".</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. Why does Nelson suggest avoiding blue wavelengths of light at night?</strong></p><p>→ Nelson says we should not look at blue colored lights at night time. This is because blue light can hurt our internal body clock which controls when we feel sleepy or awake.</p><p><br /></p><p>Our body clock (called circadian rhythm) likes darkness at night to tell the body it's time to rest. But blue light, like from phones or laptops, tricks our body clock into thinking it's still daytime.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>g. How does breathing polluted air affect one’s fatness?</strong></p><p>→ The capacity of the body to burn energy is disrupted when one is exposed to contaminated air via inhalation.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>h. What is the link between sleep and weight?</strong></p><p>→ Lack of sleep increases one's body weight. When we don't sleep enough, hormones change in a way that makes losing weight harder. So getting the right amount of sleep is important for keeping a normal weight.</p><p><br /></p><p>Critical thinking</p><p><strong>a. What do you do to keep yourself fit? What food do you avoid and why?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>I always try to be cautious about my health. Despite my busy schedule, I do all I can to avoid obesity and diseases in my body. I strictly follow healthy habits in order to maintain a healthy body and mind. Every morning, I take a walk across the surrounding area and play games with my friends. My body receives all the nourishment it needs from the food I eat on a daily basis. I avoid junk foods because they contain inedible chemicals and coloring materials. I sleep early and wake up early, which has also been critical medicine for my health.</p><p><br /></p><p>I go for walks, run, play sports. Exercise keeps body strong and heart healthy. I eat lots of fruits and vegetables. They have good nutrients and fiber. I also drink a lot of water - it's good for body. I try not to eat too much fat or sugar. Fat has extra calories so can gain weight. Sugar gives quick energy but not good for body if too much. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Healthy citizens are the greatest asset of a country. What can a state do to keep its citizens healthy?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>There are some things a state can do to help keep its citizens healthy:</p><p>Provide access to affordable healthcare. Seeing doctors regularly catches illnesses early.</p><p>Make exercise easy. Build parks, bike lanes, walking paths. Give people safe places to be active.</p><p>Healthy food choices in schools, work, stores. Fresh fruit and veggies available everywhere.</p><p>Clean air and water. Pollution harms bodies. Protections keep environment safe.</p><p>Mental health support. Stress impacts health. Give help to manage feelings.</p><p>Health education. Teach citizens how bodies work and habits for lifelong wellness.</p><p>Vaccination programs. Preventing diseases keeps all safer and stronger.</p><p>Workplace wellness. Support employees to maintain fitness and weight.</p><p><br /></p><p>Writing</p><p><strong>a.Yoga can be good to stay physically and mentally healthy. Do you practise any yoga? Write an essay on the benefits of yoga.</strong></p><p>Many people do yoga and it helps them a lot. I also do it. Yoga is good for both the body and mind.</p><p><br /></p><p>When you do yoga, you stretch your muscles. This keeps them strong and flexible. It also improves your balance and posture. All the positions in yoga work out your whole body without being hard on joints. This helps you have energy and feel good.</p><p><br /></p><p>Yoga also helps decrease stress. Slow, deep breathing during yoga calms the nerves. Holding positions requires focus, so your mind cannot think of worries for a while. After yoga, people feel relaxed and less stressed.</p><p><br /></p><p>Stress is bad for health, but yoga helps manage it. With less stress, your heart and overall health are better protected. Sleep also improves when yoga reduces stress before bed.</p><p><br /></p><p>Many like how yoga makes them feel peaceful. The breathing and moves clear extra thoughts from the mind. Then you feel calm and content. Yoga is a good way to care for the body and spirit every day. All these benefits together mean regular yoga can help you stay fit and happy.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b.How can a person be mentally healthy? Provide about ten tips to a person to stay mentally fresh and healthy.</strong></p><p>Here are 10 tips to help stay mentally healthy:</p><p><br /></p><p>Get enough sleep. Rest allows the brain to recharge and function better.</p><p>Eat healthy food. Nutritious diet gives brain fuel to work properly.</p><p>Spend time with friends and family. Social connections are important for happiness.</p><p>Try meditation or deep breathing. Take breaks to reduce stress and anxiety.</p><p>Do physical exercise. Movement helps the mind stay active and relaxed.</p><p>Learn new skills or hobby. Continually learning challenges the brain.</p><p>Limit screen and social media time. Too much can cause negative feelings.</p><p>Talk to someone if feeling sad. Sharing problems makes them feel less heavy.</p><p>Practice self-care daily.

It reflects the main theme of the essay, which is the empowerment of women in Kenya to take on the role of planting trees and caring for the environment, despite not having formal forestry diplomas. The title highlights the idea that these women, through their common sense and determination, were able to successfully engage in forestry activities without the need for formal education or diplomas.

Traits like kindness, caring for others, and helping the community are important.</p><p><br /></p><p>In my country Nepal, Dr. Harihar Adhikari is such a person. He is a bone doctor and treats patients of all ages. Since childhood, his life focus has been aiding those less fortunate.</p><p><br /></p><p>Every month and during emergencies, Dr. Adhikari runs a mobile clinic in different rural Nepal areas. His humanitarian help there is also famous. He chooses to use his money from teaching to assist needy villagers instead of luxuries in cities.</p><p><br /></p><p>When natural disasters occur like floods or earthquakes, Dr. Adhikari volunteers to aid injured people with Red Cross Nepal. He even paid for all relief supplies going to Nepal and other nations himself. We are proud of his achievements and glad for all he does. Dr. Adhikari shows how one individual can make a real difference through service and compassion.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Writing</strong></p><p><strong>B. Suppose you are MacDonald.

I will personally visit the flat to assess the situation. Thank you for your understanding.</p><p><br /></p><p>Best regards,</p><p>MacDonald</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Write an essay on 'The Community Forest in Nepal'. Describe how these community forests have contributed to maintain ecology in our environment.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>In Nepal, many villages have community forests near them. These are forests that the villagers manage together as a community. Villagers make some rules to protect the forest and only take what they need from it.</p><p><br /></p><p>By managing the forest jointly, the community forests have grown much bigger over time. More trees means more oxygen and habitat for animals. It also prevents flooding and landslides when it rains heavy. The extra trees help absorb more rainwater.</p><p><br /></p><p>Community forests provide villagers wood for building homes and fire. They also collect leaves for crops and fruits from the trees. This helps village people live without cutting all the trees down. Some even make money by selling forest products.</p><p><br /></p><p>Because everyone works as a group, the forest surroundings have stayed very green. Many types of plants and animals live here. Community forests help keep the natural environment of villages intact. They show how small communities joining together can protect a whole landscape.</p><p><br /></p><p>So in conclusion, community-managed forests in Nepal play a big role in sustaining ecology near villages. Managing forests communally helps use resources sustainably while maintaining forests for future generations.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Grammar</strong></p><p><strong>C.

"reward": "<p><strong>Project Work</strong></p><p><strong>Imagine that you are a chief guest of the programme organized by a local government on the occasion of The Environment Day. Write a 10-minute speech and deliver it to the class.</strong></p><p>Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for inviting me to speak today on this important occasion of World Environment Day.</p><p><br /></p><p>It's fitting that today we take time to appreciate our natural environment and think about how to protect it. A healthy ecosystem sustains all living things, including humans. Whether it's the air we breathe, the water we drink, or the foods we eat - our lives are dependent on clean natural resources.</p><p><br /></p><p>Yet many areas today face threats from pollution, climate change, and destruction of wildlife habitats. If we continue down this path, it will negatively impact not only animals and plants, but also human well-being and livelihoods for generations to come.</p><p><br /></p><p>As citizens, there are things each one of us can do every day to help. Walk, bike or carpool instead of driving alone when possible. Reduce waste by refusing single-use plastic and recycling properly. Support local leaders who prioritize environmental protection policies. And get involved in community clean-ups, green drives or advocacy efforts.</p><p><br /></p><p>Small acts of sustainability, if done collectively, can make a big difference over time. We must also educate future generations to care for the natural world as if their lives also depend on it - because they do!</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm heartened to see students, local officials and citizens gathered here today to raise awareness of these critical issues. By making good environmental stewardship a priority now, we can ensure our beautiful public parks, rivers and forests are enjoyed for years to come.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you for listening. Together, through communication and cooperation, I'm hopeful we can preserve our planet's natural balance for all species. Now let's enjoy the rest of this program celebrating Mother Earth!</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Identify a person from your community who has worked on environmental protection. Write a story of that person incorporating the efforts s/he made to change things and attitudes of people.</strong></p><p>In my small town lives an elderly man named Prakash. He has always had a love for nature. As a boy, Prakash enjoyed exploring the forests near his village. But over time, more of the trees disappeared as the area developed.</p><p><br /></p><p>This made Prakash very sad. He saw less birds and animals that used to live there. One day, he noticed rubbish piling up in an empty lot. Prakash decided he had to do something. First, he cleaned up the trash himself.</p><p><br /></p><p>Then Prakash spoke to the local leaders. He explained how dumping waste hurts the environment. Prakash organized community cleanups each month. Many people now help remove garbage from streets and open areas.</p><p><br /></p><p>Prakash also educated villagers on recycling and reducing plastic use. He encouraged families to plant trees on their properties. In just a few years, more greenery has returned thanks to Prakash's efforts.</p><p><br /></p><p>Most people in our town now understand nature's importance. They work to keep the community clean for future children. All because of one man named Prakash who wanted to protect the environment he loved.</p><p><br /></p>"

According to the author, what are the four types of superstition?</strong></p><p>→ According to the author, superstition may be classified into four categories. They are: vain observances; divination; idolatry; and improper worship of the true God.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Which language is the word 'superstition' derived from?&nbsp;What does it mean?</strong></p><p>→ The English term \"superstition\" was derived from Latin Supersisto. It means being terrified of God.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. How do psychologists understand superstition?</strong></p><p>→ Psychologists think superstitions may be related to fears and anxiety in our minds. Some superstitions seem like compulsions that make people feel safer.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. How does superstition differ from religion?</strong></p><p>→ Religion and superstition are not the same. Religion has beliefs about gods/goddesses and stories from holy books. It teaches right values and meanings of life.</p><p><br /></p><p>Superstitions are myths with no facts. They are fears that certain things will bring good or bad luck. People follow superstitions thinking it protects them from harm, but there's no proof.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. What is the belief of some people in Middle Europe about sneezing?</strong></p><p>→ Some people in Middle Europe think that a person's soul leaves his body when he sneezes, so they rush to bless him before the Devil can have it.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. In the author’s view, why are people so fascinated about superstition?</strong></p><p>→ Author believes that people's fascination with superstition is rooted in their desire to know their destiny and have some say in how it is determined.</p><p><br /></p><p>Critical Thinking</p><p><strong>a. What is the key takeaway of this essay? Do you think that this essay is satirical? Why?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>The main idea is that many people follow superstitions without thinking, including educated and uneducated people. Superstitions affect most of the people in society. Believing them stops society's progress.</p><p><br /></p><p>The author wants readers to question superstitions instead of blindly obeying. Religious and traditional beliefs are sometimes outdated now. Superstitions disturb normal life.</p><p><br /></p><p>This essay uses humor and exaggeration to make its point. It teases both types of people for following superstitions mindlessly. The writing style is funny and ironic, not serious. This suggests the essay uses sarcasm to gently criticize humans' natural urge to accept anything without reason.</p><p><br /></p><p>So in conclusion, the essay uses a joking tone to point out how widespread superstitions are. It aims to get people thinking rather than just believing whatever they hear without thinking critically. That's why it would be called satirical writing.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Can education bring change in the belief of superstition? Present your arguments to support your answer.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Yes, education can reduce belief in superstitions. Education builds skills like reasoning, understanding science, and sharing ideas. This environment likely reduces holding on to superstitions without basis. Questioning is empowered over accepting blindly. Education teaches critical thinking. People learn to question beliefs and not accept everything. Schools teach science, which explains the natural world. This helps see superstitions lack logic and evidence. With more knowledge, people understand things with logic rather than assuming causes without proof. </p><p><br /></p><p>Educated people can find real reasons for events, not made-up superstitious ones. Communication of ideas helps spread rational opinions over time to others. Leaders and thinkers who promote facts rather than myths can influence society. New generations with education may stop passing on old superstitions to their children. Access to information from anywhere in the world weakens local tradition beliefs. So in summary, education builds skills like reasoning, understanding science, and sharing ideas. This environment likely reduces holding on to superstitions without basis. Questioning is empowered over accepting blindly.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Writing</strong></p><p><strong>Write an essay on superstitions that exists in your community in about 250 words.</strong></p><p>Superstitions are an ingrained part of culture in Nepalese society since ancient times. Even today, many superstitious beliefs influence daily life. Some common ones relate to health, home, and natural occurrences.</p><p><br /></p><p>If someone sneezes, it is thought that someone elsewhere is gossiping about them. Many avoid sweeping at nights believing the household fortune will sweep away too. Wolves howling or owls hooting at night are seen as bad omens. Certain plants and trees in homes are considered inauspicious based on shape or features.</p><p><br /></p><p>Black cats crossing the path or breaking a mirror are taken as signs of impending misfortune. Going to barber shops or visiting temples on specific astrological days is avoided. Seeing lunar or solar eclipses without rituals could result in health issues according to faith.</p><p><br /></p><p>New ventures, exams or weddings are scheduled accounting days deemed favorable or unfavorable as per panchang calendar. Some won't start a journey or new work without temple visits and prayers for blessings.</p><p><br /></p><p>While science cannot prove these, superstitions have long been part of culture. Even educated Nepalese people carefully follow some beliefs out of habit though logic cannot support the perceived effects. They offer psychological comfort through perceived control over life's uncertainties.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. “Superstition is prevalent in every walk of life.'' Argue for or against this statement.</strong></p><p>n the past, many people believed in superstitions. But now, education and science have reduced this. Schools teach logical thinking instead of blindly accepting beliefs. Science explains nature, proving wrong ideas without evidence.</p><p><br /></p><p>Education shows proper ways to learn about the world. People see superstitions lack sense. Science discoveries clear up old ideas based on lack of knowledge. Seeing different cultures online shows beliefs were made up to understand life.</p><p><br /></p><p>In modern places, religion and spirituality replaced supernatural ideas. Young people in developing countries are less tied to past generations' baseless thinking. Some superstitions stay with less educated groups in poor areas. But even they slowly giving up silly ideas.</p><p><br /></p><p>In conclusion, as times change and knowledge spreads, people rely less on irrational beliefs. Cultural progress moves away from illogical ideas towards factual understanding. So the idea of superstitions being very common everywhere today does not always apply, especially in developed societies.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Grammar</strong></p><p><strong>B.

What were the restrictions imposed on the Blacks in South Africa?</strong></p><p>→ The Blacks in South Africa were subjected to racial segregation as well as political and economic discrimination.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Why was Mandela arrested?</strong></p><p>→ Mandela was arrested due to allegations that he had organised the ANC's armed wing.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. How did he describe racism and racial oppression?</strong></p><p>→ Racism and racial oppression were characterised as the poisonous doctrine and behaviour by him.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Why did he thank all the international guests?</strong></p><p>→ He thanked everyone in attendance for coming to share in his country's triumph for justice, peace, and human dignity with the people of his country.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. Why did he think that people in his country had achieved political emancipation?</strong></p><p>→ He thought that people in his country had achieved political emancipation. To him, political emancipation meant that individuals had broken free from the oppression of poverty, lack of opportunity, and suffering on account of their gender or other characteristics.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. What is the main point of Mandela's speech?</strong></p><p>→ Mandela's major points in his speech was that people in South Africa should work together to create a peaceful and harmonious society in which there is equal opportunity for everyone.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Critical thinking</strong></p><p><strong>a. What does Mandela mean when he says - a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world?</strong></p><p>When Mandela talks about a \"rainbow nation\", he means bringing all people together in South Africa like the colors in a rainbow. Before, South Africa split people by skin color with apartheid rules. Now Mandela wanted different cultures, races and groups to live united as one nation.</p><p><br /></p><p>Just as a rainbow has many beautiful colors together, South Africa would have people from all backgrounds respected equally. The \"rainbow nation\" represents mixing of customs and traditions into one peaceful place. This was Mandela's dream after the unfair apartheid system separated white and black for so long.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Mandela should have avenged those who imprisoned him for such a long period. Instead, he followed the path of reconciliation. Why do you think he did so?</strong></p><p>Mandela could have punished those who jailed him for years. But he wanted South Africa at peace, not fighting. His goal was bringing people back together after apartheid split the country.</p><p><br /></p><p>Mandela believed forgiving enemies, not revenge. Hate divides while love unites people in the country. He wanted healing old wounds, so everyone gets along in the new democracy.</p><p><br /></p><p>As president, his big job was fixing society's problems, not settling personal egos. Mandela ended unfair rules against all groups. His power aimed to help people, not get back at those who hurt him alone.</p><p><br /></p><p>Revenge creates more anger and problems. Mandela chose kindness instead to make South Africa strong with the people working as friends, not still divided. This path of bringing people together in forgiveness after apartheid is why he did not seek revenge.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Why and how have societies struggled with segregation in the world? Do you find any evidence of segregation in your society? Discuss.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Societies struggle with segregation, which means dividing people unfairly by things like race or location. Even though it is banned, habits still keep some separation between the people. This causes problems worldwide.</p><p><br /></p><p>Segregation denies equal rights by treating some as less important. Poor communities and minorities often feel outside main society due to unfair second-class labeling. This breaks unity and fairness between all people in the society.</p><p><br /></p><p>In our society, seen in Nepal's past is segregating or mistreating women, lower castes and minority religions. Legally now banned, but traditions have still stopped some people from entering temple areas. The system exists despite laws against it. While laws protect rights, deep-rooted old customs persist in societies everywhere when change happens slowly over time. Maintaining equal respect and rights for all promotes greater harmony.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Writing</strong></p><p><strong>a. Nepal has topsy-turvy political history. Many changes have been observed in different times. Write a short biography of any Nepali freedom fighter incorporating the changes brought under his/her leadership.</strong></p><p>Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala (BP Koirala) was an important freedom fighter in Nepal's history. He was born in India in 1914 to a political family.</p><p><br /></p><p>As a student in India, he learned about democracy. This influenced him to help Nepal gain freedom. In 1947, he returned and started the Nepali Congress party to end the rule of the Rana family.</p><p><br /></p><p>Under his leadership, people protested in 1950 and the Ranas lost power. Nepal became a kingdom with new rules. This helped create a more fair system.</p><p><br /></p><p>In 1959, BP Koirala became Nepal's first elected Prime Minister. He made changes to help rural communities. However, in 1960 the King took back control and BP was exiled.</p><p><br /></p><p>In 1977, after nearly two decades in exile, B.P. Koirala was allowed to return to Nepal. He continued to play a vital role in Nepali politics, striving for democratic principles and social justice until his passing in 1982.</p><p><br /></p><p>His brave work helped Nepal to get rid of autocracy run by one family to a free country wih just and equal rights given to people. Even today, people remember his brave spirit for equality and freedom.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Do you think there is racial/caste related discrimination in our ( nepalese ) country? Discuss with your friend; write a five-minute speech.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Good afternoon everyone,</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm here today to discuss an important issue in our society - that of racial and caste-based discrimination in Nepal. As you all know, our country was once ruled by a feudal system that divided people based on their caste. While the new constitution has outlawed this practice, the attitudes of generations do not change overnight.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sadly, there are still many ways in which discrimination exists. Those born into so-called \"lower\" castes face unequal access to opportunities. In some remote villages, the untouchability practice of banning certain castes from temples or public places is still followed unofficially.</p><p><br /></p><p>Women from all backgrounds also experience discrimination due to patriarchal mindsets. They face barriers to education, health services and participation in politics or businesses. Minority ethnic and indigenous groups also report instances of racial or linguistic profiling in certain contexts.</p><p><br /></p><p>While our laws have progressed, changing people's hearts and minds requires ongoing work. We must start meaningful conversations to increase understanding between different communities. Leaders at all levels must set an example of inclusive governance.</p><p><br /></p><p>As the youth, it is up to us to create a more just, tolerant and cooperative society. We must judge others based on their character, not their family name or background. Together, through compassion and solidarity, I believe we can build a nation where every citizen enjoys equal dignity and rights. Thank you for your time.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Grammar</strong></p><p><strong>B. Complete the sentences with should or shouldn't.

Why didn't the mother recognise her son Gopi?</strong></p><p>→ The mother forgot who her son Gopi was because she was very old.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Why is the sister living with her mother?</strong></p><p>→ The sister lives with her mother to take care of her, as the sister is now alone (widow).</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What is the sister’s attitude towards her brother?</strong></p><p>→ The sister has clear opinions about her brother's personality. She knows that his affections about his mother are fake. He would have kept contacting her earlier if he truly cared.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Does the son love his mother very much? How do you know that?</strong></p><p>→ We know he loves his mother very much because he gently kisses her cheeks, showing affection by being very close.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. What does the mother actually need: a blanket or the warmth of her son’s love?</strong></p><p>→ The mother really needs the warmth of her son's love more than blankets.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. What does the phrase 'the tattered blanket’ mean? Is it only the blanket that is tattered?</strong></p><p>→ \"Tattered blanket\" refers to the broken family relationship, not just the physical blanket.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>g. The son says, ‘Amma can't remember who I am’. Do you think that he remembered his mother? Why didn’t he answer when his sister asked, ‘Do you remember your Amma?’</strong></p><p>→ No, he did not remember his mother well because he had not contacted her for 5 years. That's why he didn't reply when asked if he remembers her.</p><p><br /></p><p>Critical thinking</p><p><strong>(a) What can be the expectations of the parents from their offspring at old age?</strong></p><p>As parents age, they naturally lose strength and abilities. In their golden years, all they want is respect and care from their children in return for sacrificing so much in raising them.</p><p><br /></p><p>When young, parents invested a large share of resources and effort to nurture their kids. Now in old age, they don't expect much but hope children will love them, appreciate their support, and provide for needs if illness strikes.</p><p><br /></p><p>Specifically, aging moms and dads look to chilldrens for love, companionship, healthy meals, comfortable living, regular medical checkups. Plus attention to any advice from years of experience. Since they spend devoting a lifetime to kids, it's understandable parents see this kindness and consideration as the natural order in their final years.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>(b) Some children who live far away tend to be indifferent to the feelings of their parents. Why do you think they are like that?</strong>&nbsp;Discuss.</p><p>Parents' relationships with their children deteriorate when they live far away. For various circumstances, children get separated from their parents. It may be for school, work, or a business. They'll need to put in more time and effort if they want to succeed. It results in the gap or separation between parents and children.</p><p><br /></p><p>Today's generation prioritises money and achievement above parent's sentiments. People work hard to earn money and save it, but it doesn't satisfy their parents. Some youngsters move away from home to start a new life with their family. Their spouse and children take priorities to them over their ageing parents. As a result, they are unable to contact or visit their parents due to a lack of free time.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>(c) A mother’s love is everlasting and indispensable. Justify.</strong></p><p>No one cares for a child with more selflessness and dedication than their mother. A mother's love is unconditional and priceless.</p><p><br /></p><p>Kids see their moms as more than just parents - they are best friends, teachers, guides and constant supporters. Mothers give endless time, energy and affection to children even at their own expense.</p><p><br /></p><p>This lifelong bond between a mother and child forms the foundation for developing strong character and cultural values in a person.</p><p><br /></p><p>As the emotional anchor of the family, a mother ensures everyone feels loved, secure and able to trust her completely. Her deep commitment to raising her children leaves nothing left to give in old age - so they deserve caring support in return.</p><p><br /></p><p>This justifies why a mother's love will never fade and remains irreplaceable in a person's life from cradle to grave. The special bond between a mother and child is truly everlasting and indispensable.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>B. Suppose a child who lived in a city with his/her parents accompanied his/her father to visit an elderly grandmother in the village. The grandmother was waiting for her son to come back to the village and look after her, but her son was not willing to do so. Write a diary on behalf of the elderly grandmother describing her feeling of not living with her children and grandchildren.</strong></p><p>Dear Diary,</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm feeling so lonely sitting here in this small house all by myself. It has been years since my children moved to the city, seeking better opportunities. While I'm happy they are doing well, my heart aches with missing them.</p><p><br /></p><p>This village has been my home for so long but it's less lively now with my friends also passing on. I try to keep busy by gardening and helping others, but at night the silence reminds me of how empty my days have become.</p><p><br /></p><p>I had hoped at least one of my children would stay or that I could go live with them. But they say they don't have enough space. My son came to visit last week with my darling grandson. Seeing their smiles brought me such joy, if only for a moment.</p><p><br /></p><p>When they left again the loneliness returned twice as strong. My son said the city is no place for an old woman like me. But I don't feel so old - my mind is still sharp and my hands willing. I just want to be with my family, surrounded by love once more.</p><p><br /></p><p>It pains me they don't need me anymore in their lives. All I did was give them everything I had. Now in my twilight years, all I ask for is companionship - but it seems even that is too much to hope for. I only wish I didn't have to end my days alone in this big empty house.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Grammar</strong></p><p><strong>B.

One resident described her relief at community programs delivering meals and medication, offering respite from an otherwise solitary routine.</p><p><br /></p><p>Others expressed feelings of uselessness or depression isolating in empty homes, missing the bustle of family celebrations. Physical health also declines more rapidly without vibrant social engagement.</p><p><br /></p><p>It's clear our society still has progress to make in upholding elders with the same care they once gave us. While adult children carry responsibilities of their own, more support systems could ease the burden of aging alone.</p><p><br /></p><p>Increased community outreach, improving accessibility, and developing intergenerational activities may enrich seniors' quality of life. Pooling local resources shows our valuable elders they have not been forgotten in their farewell years. None of us know when we may find ourselves in their shoes, so empathy can help end these solitudes.</p><p><br /></p>"

Do you agree with Machiavelli's view that a good leader can do bad and dishonest things in order to preserve his power and protect his government?&nbsp;Explain.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Yes, I agree. Power and influence in politics can be addictive. When leaders want to keep their power, they sometimes break rules. Even good leaders can make mistakes to stay in power and protect their authority. They might misuse their influence and wealth.</p><p><br /></p><p>Leaders can forget their moral values because they want more power, money, or fame. They fear losing their authority and might do wrong things. Some politicians will do anything for power, no matter the consequences.</p><p><br /></p><p>Leadership can lead to addiction to pleasure from power, reputation, and money. It's important to think about goals and promises before becoming a leader.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Do you think that art and literature are important assets of a country?</strong>&nbsp;Give reasons.</p><p>Yes, art and culture are valuable assets that benefit a nation in many ways. They are an important part of a country's identity, representing its people, history and traditions.</p><p><br /></p><p>Through artistic and literary works, different cultures and eras can experience and connect with each other visually and audibly. This helps promote cultural exchange and understanding globally.</p><p><br /></p><p>Creating and promoting art/literature also provides significant economic advantages. Jobs are created for many people involved in production, management and distribution. Tax revenue from art industries supports the government.</p><p><br /></p><p>It gives a voice to communities that may otherwise not be heard. Art can even influence technology with real-world applications. Widespread popularity enhances international recognition of a culture. Overall, enriching a nation's culture through art and literature has various social, economic and diplomatic impacts.</p><p><br /></p><p>Writing</p><p><strong>a) Write an essay on “Literature is the reflection of society.”</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Title - Literature is the Reflection of Society</p><p><br /></p><p>Literature is a mirror that reflects the society and time in which it was created. Great writers are often inspired by the world happening around them. Through their works of fiction and non-fiction, they can capture important events, cultural norms and mindsets prevalent in their era.</p><p><br /></p><p>The characters, themes, language and details included in novels, short stories, poems and plays frequently depict aspects of the author's society. Readers can learn about history, politics, social issues and lifestyles of the period. Literature gives insights into the struggles, values and dreams common to a community.</p><p><br /></p><p>Different genres also emerged as an expression of society at various stages. In times of conflict or change, literature has voiced protest or debate on important matters. During periods of cultural flowering, it has celebrated traditions and inspired new ideas.</p><p><br /></p><p>Even perceptions of universal topics like love, family and journey of the human spirit are influenced by cultural context. Literature, therefore, acts as a profound vessel transporting its audience to a certain place and time through the fantastic realm of imagination and word. In doing so, it holds an insightful mirror to the society from which it was born.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b) It is said that today’s reader is tomorrow’s leader. Do you agree with this statement?</strong>&nbsp;Explain.</p><p>Reading helps expand one's knowledge and perspective on various issues. As readers expose themselves to new ideas through literature, they gain valuable insights and learn important lessons. </p><p><br /></p><p>Reading also develops important communication skills in an individual. The ability to absorb new information, analyze concepts and articulate views are all developed through regular reading. </p><p><br /></p><p>Exposing oneself to biographies and histories of great leaders can inspire today's readers to emerge as better leaders tomorrow. They learn from successes and failures of past leaders. This shapes their vision, problem-solving approach and motivates them.</p><p><br /></p><p>A well-read person is usually more empathetic, open-minded and socially aware too. All of these attributes make someone a strong, people-centric leader. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c) Write a short biography of a national literary, artistic or historical figure you appreciate most.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Lakshmi Prasad Devkota (1909-1959)</p><p><br /></p><p>Born in Kasimkot village of Nepal, Devkota was a gifted poet and writer who greatly enriched Nepali literature. He received his early education in Nepal and India. Devkota developed a strong interest in poetry from a young age. Devkota started writing poetry during his school days. Many of his early poems expressed his deep patriotism for Nepal.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the 1930s, Devkota helped establish the Nepali literary renaissance. He wrote dozens of poems, stories and essays during this time. Devkota's magnum opus was the epic poem 'Muna Madan'. Published in 1956, it brought him widespread acclaim as a master poet.</p><p><br /></p><p>Beyond literature, Devkota served in important government roles over the years including editor of Gorkhapatra newspaper. He promoted Nepali culture and identity through his writings. Devkota received several national awards for his contributions.</p><p><br /></p><p>Devkota passed away in 1959, leaving behind an immense body of work that continues to inspire Nepali literature to this day. He is considered one of Nepal's greatest literary icons.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Grammar</strong></p><p><strong>B.

On the basis of your reading of the story, point out some special elements of this kind of writing?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Fantasy literature features unreal people and events unlike real life. Common fantasy elements include magical objects, enchanted lands, supernatural powers and mythical creatures.</p><p><br /></p><p>In such fantasy stories, characters often do quests involving honor, loyalty, solving mysteries or completing challenging tasks. Such stories frequently transport readers to imagined places across time like magical kingdoms, mystical forests or alternative universes.</p><p><br /></p><p>A wide variety of non-human characters play roles such as wizards, elves, fairies alongside humans like knights and rulers. Popular fantasy also includes talking animals and magical beings like angels, demons or unicorns.</p><p><br /></p><p>Overall, fantasy writing transports audiences to magical worlds and scenarios not bound by real-world limits through imaginative storytelling and extraordinary people and forces beyond scientific explanation. This creates a sense of wonder and adventure.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Is it good to imagine things which are not possible to achieve in reality?</strong>&nbsp;Explain.</p><p><br /></p><p>I think it is fine and must do things to imagine because the first step to get anything is to dream of it. Our aspirations, actions, and behaviours are all shaped by our fantasies. A person's goal, purpose, and strategy all begin in their imagination before becoming a reality.</p><p><br /></p><p>Imagining the impossible fuels creativity. It allows the mind to envision innovations that could someday become realities through advancements. This drives human progress.</p><p><br /></p><p>When someone has a clear idea of what he wants to achieve, he can see his goal and the way to get there more clearly. According to many researchers, successful people see their goals in their minds before taking action to make them a reality. In addition, we need to cultivate traits like openness, enthusiasm, devotion, and commitment in order to make things happen. Then, we can actually turn fantasy to reality.</p><p><br /></p><p>However, excessively unrealistic expectations could harm productivity if unrealistic goals prevent focusing on the real life. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Do you talk to yourself when you are in a trouble? If yes, how does it help you?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Talking to yourself when facing problems can help in several ways. Explaining your situation out loud brings more clarity and can spark good ideas. Discussing options from different angles tests which may work best.</p><p><br /></p><p>Encouraging self-talk with positive phrases like \"I can do this\" boosts confidence to deal with challenges. Making verbal plans keeps you responsible to follow through on solving the issue.</p><p><br /></p><p>Saying how you feel reduces stress by lessening worries and distractions. This allows thinking through solutions more calmly. Sharing anxieties, even just with yourself, lessens how overwhelming worries feel.</p><p><br /></p><p>In difficult times, self-talk helps in clear thinking and finding inner strength by verbally working through issues from multiple sides. This process leads to handling problems more effectively.</p><p><br /></p><p>Writing</p><p><strong>a. Narrate, in short, a folktale that you have read or heard.</strong></p><p>Once upon a time, there was a clever rabbit who lived in the forest. One day, a fierce lion moved into the same forest and started hunting all the animals.</p><p><br /></p><p>The rabbit, wanting to save his fellow animals, came up with a plan. He went to the lion and said, \"Oh mighty lion, I have heard that you are the strongest animal in the forest, but I don't believe it. I think you are weaker than the king of the jungle.\"</p><p><br /></p><p>The lion was furious and asked, \"Who dares to challenge me?\"</p><p><br /></p><p>The rabbit replied, \"Follow me, and I will show you the true king of the jungle.\"</p><p><br /></p><p>The lion, filled with pride, followed the rabbit deep into the forest. When they reached a well, the rabbit pointed to his own reflection in the water and said, \"There he is, the true king of the jungle!\"</p><p><br /></p><p>The lion saw his own reflection and thought it was another lion. He roared and jumped into the well to fight the rival lion. But, of course, he couldn't find anyone there. He had been tricked.</p><p><br /></p><p>The clever rabbit saved his fellow animals, and they all celebrated his intelligence. And from that day on, the lion never bothered the other animals in the forest again.</p><p><br /></p><p>And that's the end of the folktale about the clever rabbit and the proud lion.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Describe a strange dream that you have seen recently.</strong></p><p>I dreamed that I was walking through a thick foggy forest at night. All the trees looked unfamiliar and I couldn't see very far in any direction. As I kept walking, the fog seemed to get thicker and it was hard to know if I was going in circles or not.</p><p><br /></p><p>Suddenly, I started hearing strange noises all around me. There were low sounds and cracking branches, but I couldn't see where the sounds were coming from through the heavy fog. I began to feel afraid, like something was watching me.</p><p><br /></p><p>That's when the ground suddenly disappeared beneath my feet! I found myself falling down what seemed like an endless hole. Just as I was sure I was going to crash at the bottom, I woke up with a start in my bed.</p><p><br /></p><p>My heart was racing as I tried to process the very bizarre dream. The strange surroundings, creepy noises and sudden fall all made it quite an unsettling yet memorable nighttime experience. Even though it was just a dream, it definitely left me feeling disoriented!</p><p><br /></p><p>Grammar</p><p><strong>B. Express your wishes in the following situations in three different ways. Use I wish/If only.</strong></p><p>a. You don’t have a mobile phone (You need one).</p><p>→ I wish somebody would give me a mobile.</p><p>I wish I could get enough money to buy a phone..</p><p>I wish I could buy one myself.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>b. You don’t know the answer to a question from the lesson.</p><p>→ I wish I could answer the question.</p><p>I wish somebody would tell me the answer.</p><p>I wish I knew the answer.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>c.

It’s cold.</p><p>→ I wish I could light the fire.</p><p>I wish my mother would burn some firewood.</p><p>I wish I drank hot water.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>e. You are feeling sick.</p><p>→ I wish I could go to the hospital.</p><p>I wish I were healthy.</p><p>I wish somebody would call a doctor.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>f.

How did Mahabir Pun begin his lifelong journey in Nepal after coming back to Nepal from the US?</strong></p><p>→ After returning to Nepal from the United States, Mahabir Pun decided to remain in his hometown of Nangi in the Myagdi district and assist the locals establish a high school and himself work as a volunteer teacher. This started his lifetime journey in Nepal.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Why didn't he want to work for other companies in the US or in Nepal?</strong></p><p>→ He didn't believe in having a better life by doing work for others, so he didn't want to work for other businesses in the US or Nepal.

Why was he involved in innovation?</strong></p><p>→ He was involved in innovation to increase the horizon of his thinking skills and critical objectivity.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. What are the income-generating programmes that he helped to start?</strong></p><p>→ As a means of income generating program, he helped construct a hiking camp, cheese and jam production facilities, paper and beekeeping businesses, vegetable and cattle farming, handicraft manufacture, and fish farming.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e.

How have developed countries become prosperous?</strong></p><p>→ Developed nations have prospered because they place a high value on research and development, spending vast sums of money in it.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>g. How can we keep the most talented and innovative people in Nepal?</strong></p><p>→ We can keep the best and innovative minds in Nepal by providing a good environment and a good system of support for them.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Critical thinking</strong></p><p><strong>a. Pun says, “We do not have a culture of innovation that encourages young people to be innovative and creative”. Do you agree with him?</strong>&nbsp;Explain.</p><p><br /></p><p>Yes, I totally agree. Innovation is key to economic growth but it's lacking emphasis in Nepal's education system. While students excel academically, developing new ideas remains secondary to them. Limited focus is given to research and creativity in schools/colleges.</p><p><br /></p><p>Successful economies highly value R&amp;D ( Research and developement), allocating significant funds to cultivate innovation. Our schools don't inspire creative, out-of-box thinking. As society discourages risk-taking, students lack opportunities. The education framework of textbooks/classrooms have not even changed a little. Thus thousands of students annually leave to further their education.</p><p><br /></p><p>To foster innovative thinking, its importance must be taught in classrooms. Those with technical skills don't want to stay and work here due to lack of supportive environment. The government's role is creating conditions and support to retain Nepal's brightest minds who drive new ideas and economic transformation. Prioritizing research from an young age can help address this challenge.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. What qualities does an individual need to become an entrepreneur?</strong></p><p>The key qualities needed to become a successful entrepreneur are:</p><p><br /></p><p>Ideas - Entrepreneurs need to identify problems and come up with innovative solutions through new business ideas.</p><p><br /></p><p>Risk taking - They must be willing to take risks by investing time/money in untested ideas that may fail. Learning from mistakes is important.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hard work - Running a business requires long hours of hard work to turn ideas into reality and ensure it grows successfully.</p><p><br /></p><p>Confidence - Self-belief is important to have the courage to follow dreams despite challenges and doubts of others.</p><p><br /></p><p>Communication - Excellent speaking and writing skills are required to pitch ideas, market products/services and manage teams.</p><p><br /></p><p>Financial skills - Managing money properly through budgeting, investments, expenses is crucial for business sustainability.</p><p><br /></p><p>Determination - With setbacks inevitable, entrepreneurs need grit to keep pursuing goals persistently until achieving success.</p><p><br /></p><p>Leadership - To hire and lead employees, good management and people skills are essential for efficiency.</p><p><br /></p><p>So in brief, the primary needs are innovative ideas, passion for risks, drive to work hard and belief in oneself with supporting business/people skills.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Writing</strong></p><p><strong>A.

What can be the qualities of a great leader? Can a great leader remain in power for long in a country? Discuss.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>A successful political leader has a wide range of qualities, including responsibility, sincerity, tolerance, authenticity, adaptability, and confidence. Yes, a leader can remain in power for the long run if he governs following the ethics.</p><p><br /></p><p>But, only a few of the world's effective political leaders adhere to sound leadership ideals. Unfortunately, a large number of elected leaders lack the most basic leadership skills. Many examples may be found in history and current events that show the importance of adherence to leadership ideals in politics.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. The 16th president of the USA, Abraham Lincoln said democracy is government of the people for the people and by the people. Do you think it is perfectly applicable in the present context of Nepal?</strong>&nbsp;Explain.</p><p><br /></p><p>Abraham Lincoln said a true democracy has government that is of, by, and for the people. This applies to Nepal today.</p><p><br /></p><p>For a democracy to work well, citizens must be able to freely choose leaders through fair elections. Elected leaders should serve the people by addressing their needs.</p><p><br /></p><p>Government decisions must be transparent so people know they are represented. Laws must treat everyone equally and protect rights. Minority voices should also be heard.</p><p><br /></p><p>Citizens need freedom to share views, gather peaceably and take part in discussions. An independent judiciary guards democracy's principles.</p><p><br /></p><p>While principles are universal, each country faces unique challenges applying them. Nepal continues strengthening democratic institutions, processes, and protecting rights to better reflect citizens' will in governance. Upholding people's role ensures true democracy.</p><p><br /></p><p>Writing</p><p><strong>a. Write an essay on Power and Politics in about 500 words.</strong></p><p>Power and politics are linked very closely. Politics is all about power - who has it and who doesn't. When people or groups have power, they can influence decisions and control resources.</p><p><br /></p><p>There are different types of power. Political power means control over governments and laws. Money is also a type of power because those with wealth can influence choices. Other powers include physical force, knowledge and skills, and relationships with important groups.</p><p><br /></p><p>In politics, people try to gain power in governments so they can make rules. They do this through elections where citizens vote. Political parties compete for votes by promising policies and programs if they win. People vote for the parties they think will help them the most.</p><p><br /></p><p>Elected politicians then have political power to pass laws and control state resources. They make decisions about taxes, spending, trade rules and many other important issues. At the same time, lobby groups try to influence politicians too. Groups with money, members or useful knowledge put pressure on those in power.</p><p><br /></p><p>Power can change hands through both elections and other means. When enough citizens vote a new party into office, that party gains political control. But sometimes power transfers happen through other ways like military coups or revolutions if the public loses faith in political leaders.</p><p><br /></p><p>Having power opens opportunities for both good and bad outcomes. Leaders can use their position positively to help citizens through wise policies. But power can also corrupt some and make them act for selfish reasons instead of the public good. Maintaining checks and balances helps distribute power and prevents its abuse.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the end, politics is greatly shaped by the struggles over power between different factions in society. Understanding power dynamics is key to comprehending how decisions get made and countries are governed. Power lies at the heart of all political systems and will continue influencing events into the future.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Write a couple of paragraphs about a national hero who fought bravely in the Anglo-Nepal War.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Bhimsen Thapa was a leading Nepali general during the Anglo-Nepal War in 1814-16. He played a very important role in defending Nepal against the invading British Indian forces. Under his command, the Nepali army was able to withstand repeated attacks by the better equipped British troops. Bhimsen Thapa employed clever military strategies and tactics suited for fighting in Nepal's difficult mountain terrain. He inspired the soldiers to fight with courage and determination against a much stronger foreign enemy. Due to his brilliant leadership as Commander-in-Chief, the Nepali forces succeeded in forcing the British to sign an unfavorable treaty, thereby protecting Nepal's independence.</p><p><br /></p><p>Bhimsen Thapa is remembered as one of Nepal's greatest patriots and heroes for his role in the Anglo-Nepal War. Despite facing huge obstacles, he mobilized the Nepali army and guided them to remarkable victories. His brave and skilled generalship helped defend Nepal's sovereignty from colonial domination. To this day, Nepalis revere Bhimsen Thapa for his selfless service to the nation during its hour of need. He made enormous sacrifices to ensure that Nepal remained independent and self-governing. Bhimsen Thapa's valor and military accomplishments continue to inspire new generations of Nepalis.</p><p><br /></p><p>Grammar</p><p><strong>B.

They …… themselves at the first light of morning.</p><p>→ They bestir themselves at the first light of morning.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Comprehension</p><p><strong>Answer these questions.</strong></p><p><strong>a. Why was the Italian Socialist Mergari treated like a madman?</strong></p><p>→ The Italian Socialist Mergari dared to utter a few normal human words. So, he was labelled a madman.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Can political aims be attained by the criminal instrumentality of war?</strong>&nbsp;If yes, how?</p><p>→ Yes, the illegal instrumentality of war may be used to achieve political goals. Politicians may achieve their political objectives by stirring up patriotic sentiments among the general public.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Which hopes and plans were said to be mutually contradictory?</strong></p><p>→ It was said that a fresh atrocity of unimaginable proportions was the product of conflicting hopes and plans.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. What can be the sacred duty of every man of good will on earth?</strong></p><p>→ Rather than sheathing ourselves in apathy and letting things take their course, it is our moral responsibility as men of good will to do all in our power to avoid the ultimate disaster.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. Is it good to tacitly accept war as an instrument of politics?</strong>&nbsp;If not, what else should be done?</p><p>→ Only a small minority of individuals really want the continuation of the conflict. They are deserving of our utmost scorn and animosity.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. How can we stop war in the world?</strong></p><p>→ If we are sincere, committed and selfless, we can put an end to the conflict.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>g. What is the main message of this essay?</strong></p><p>→ The essay discusses the atrocities of World War I, as well as how warmongers resist bringing peace. It conveys the idea that world peace is inescapable and that conflict may be ended by concerted efforts by humanity.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Critical thinking</p><p><strong>a. Are warmongers the greatest enemies for peace? What do you want to suggest to them?</strong></p><p>→ Warmongers who start wars and fights are not good for peace. While some wars in the past worked to stop violence and protect people, those who only want to hurt others and cause problems are clearly against peace.</p><p><br /></p><p>I would suggest to warmongers that they should think more about humanity. They should stop conflicts that hurt and kill innocent people. All human beings deserve to live without fear and conflict. My hope is that warmongers will choose peace over war and stop actions that undermine the safety and well-being of communities.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. The Nobel Prize winner American novelist John Steinbeck 1920 1968 on said “all war is a symptom of man’s failure as a thinking animal.” Do you agree with the novelist?</strong>&nbsp;Why?</p><p><br /></p><p>I agree with John Steinbeck. War happens because humans do not think properly. There are better ways to solve problems instead of fighting. When countries go to war, everyone suffers.</p><p><br /></p><p>War only destroys and does not help anyone. It damages the environment and economies of all countries involved, whether they win or lose. The two world wars were especially bad and killed many people. Dropping atomic bombs on Japan at the end of World War 2 killed over 140,000 people instantly in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Everyone saw how terrible the destruction was.</p><p><br /></p><p>Civilized people should talk out their differences instead of fighting. Going to war shows that human thinking has failed. Learning from history, humans now know fighting will not solve anything and only makes problems much worse. There are always better answers than violence if people take time to think carefully. John Steinbeck was right that war happens because humans do not use their minds well.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Does any war end all wars and bring lasting peace to the world?</strong>&nbsp;Discuss.</p><p>No, no war can end all wars or bring permanent peace. While some wars in the past have ended conflicts, they have never solved problems in a lasting way.</p><p><br /></p><p>World Wars 1 and 2 left behind too much destruction that can never be fixed. Instead of fighting, there are better options like negotiations where both sides agree to compromise. That way everyone benefits in some way.</p><p><br /></p><p>Fighting will continue forever if countries have unlimited resources. Wars do not lead to real peace. The goal of peace is not realistic in the short term.</p><p><br /></p><p>Now wars could destroy whole countries or the world because of nuclear and biological weapons. Most countries have these weapons of mass destruction. Fighting now only breeds more conflict and suffering rather than peace.</p><p><br /></p><p>Nations will suffer psychological and economic damage after any war. Using force is not a solution and will not help achieve world peace. To get lasting peace, countries must find other ways besides violence and war. Permanent peace requires understanding between all people and nations.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Why do you think countries go to war?</strong></p><p>There are a few main reasons why countries start wars:</p><p><br /></p><p>Resources - Countries may attack another to gain access to their natural resources like oil, gold, land or other materials.</p><p><br /></p><p>Religion - Sometimes people feel they must force their religious beliefs on others. This can cause conflicts between groups or nations.</p><p><br /></p><p>Lack of understanding - Wars happen when countries do not communicate well and try to understand each other's positions. They don't talk peacefully to find solutions. Each side thinks they are completely right and the other side is completely wrong.</p><p><br /></p><p>Countries use violence when they don't accept other viewpoints. Wars only end when sides can agree and see each other's perspectives. But violence keeps happening when groups keep refusing to cooperate and resolve differences through respectful discussion instead of attacks. Good communication is important to prevent wars between nations with differing views.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Writing</strong></p><p><strong>Write essays in about 500 words on the following topics.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>a. War and peace</strong></p><p>War and peace have shaped human history. War brings destruction, suffering, and chaos. Peace brings stability, harmony, and the chance for prosperity.</p><p><br /></p><p>War has caused much death and damage through history for reasons like politics, economics, or ideas. It hurts societies, economies, and the environment. In chasing power or resources, nations have clashed and caused human pain.</p><p><br /></p><p>But people have always wanted peace. Leaders and movements have worked for peace through talking, not fighting. They want to solve problems without violence. Peace means more than no war - it means justice, fairness, and cooperation. Peace lets nations thrive and people live without fear. It helps use resources for development, education, and healthcare.</p><p><br /></p><p>In today's world, peace is very important. Countries are now closely connected. Modern weapons can easily destroy. Groups like the United Nations try to encourage talking, cooperation and non-violence between countries.</p><p><br /></p><p>Keeping peace is complex. It requires understanding between different cultures and societies. It demands addressing the root causes of conflict like poverty, inequality and unfairness. Building peace takes diplomacy globally and education locally.</p><p><br /></p><p>Individual choices also matter - to have dialogue over confrontation, and find common ground with others. As world citizens, we can support peace and speak against violence. Working together through justice, fairness and cooperation, humanity can achieve a future with real and lasting peace.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Responsive youths for peace and prosperity</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Youth, often referred to as the torchbearers of the future, play a pivotal role in shaping the destiny of nations. Their energy, enthusiasm, and idealism can be harnessed to create positive change, especially in fostering peace and prosperity. Responsive youths, who are actively engaged in addressing societal challenges, hold the key to building a more harmonious and prosperous world.</p><p><br /></p><p>Responsive youths are those who recognize the issues affecting their communities and society at large and take proactive measures to address them. They are not passive observers but active participants in the quest for peace and prosperity. </p><p><br /></p><p>Responsive youths are often at the forefront of efforts to resolve conflicts peacefully. They engage in dialogue, mediate disputes, and promote reconciliation within their communities.</p><p><br /></p><p>Many young people are driven by a desire to make a positive impact. They create social enterprises that address pressing issues such as poverty, education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability, contributing to economic prosperity and social well-being.</p><p><br /></p><p>Responsive youths are passionate advocates for social justice, human rights, and environmental sustainability. They use their voices and platforms to raise awareness, influence policies, and drive change.</p><p><br /></p><p>To promote prosperity, responsive youths recognize the importance of education and skill development. They empower themselves and others with knowledge and skills that can lead to economic growth and development.</p><p><br /></p><p>Responsive youths actively engage with their communities, seeking to understand their needs and aspirations. They initiate and support community development projects that enhance the quality of life for all.</p><p><br /></p><p>In a globalized world, responsive youths appreciate the interconnectedness of global challenges. They collaborate with peers from different cultures and nations to address common issues, promoting international understanding and cooperation.</p><p><br /></p><p>Many responsive youths serve as mentors and role models for younger generations, passing on knowledge, values, and a sense of responsibility for building a peaceful and prosperous world.</p><p><br /></p><p>However, responsive youths face challenges in their efforts. These challenges include limited resources, access to quality education and opportunities, and sometimes resistance from established systems. To fully harness the potential of youth for peace and prosperity, society must provide support, mentorship, and resources to empower them.</p><p><br /></p><p>In conclusion, responsive youths are catalysts for positive change in society. Their commitment to peace and prosperity serves as a beacon of hope for a better future. It is incumbent upon communities, governments, and institutions to recognize, nurture, and empower the youth, ensuring they have the tools and opportunities to lead us toward a more harmonious and prosperous world. By investing in youth, we invest in a brighter future for all.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

What’s the difference between the body and the soul?</strong></p><p>→ The body is our physical self; it's what we can see and touch, like our arms, legs, and organs. The soul, on the other hand, is often seen as our inner self, our thoughts, emotions, and consciousness.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. What do you understand by the psychologists’ saying that there is no such thing as mind?</strong></p><p>→ When psychologists say that there is no such thing as the \"mind,\" they are often referring to the idea that the mind is not a separate, distinct entity from the brain or the physical processes of the body. Instead, they suggest that mental processes, thoughts, emotions, and consciousness are the result of complex interactions within the brain and the nervous system.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. How can a mental activity be reduced to a physical activity?</strong></p><p>→ The reduction of mental activity to physical activity involves studying how the physical processes in the brain give rise to thoughts, emotions, and consciousnes. It's a complex area of study that continues to evolve as our understanding of the brain and the mind deepens.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. How are mind and body related?</strong></p><p>→ The mind and the body are interrelated because they serve as handy organisational frameworks for the actions that we do.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. What is the relation between mind and memory?&nbsp;Does memory survive a person's death?</strong></p><p>→ Memories are formed through processes in the brain when we learn or experience something. The brain stores memories through connections between neurons. When a person dies, their brain and body die as well. The physical processes that encoded and stored memories no longer function.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. How is our power on the earth's surface entirely dependent upon the sun?</strong></p><p>→ Our power on the surface of the Earth is completely dependent on the sun, which heats our oceans, controls our weather patterns, and provides energy to the growing green plants that supply us with food and oxygen.</p><p><br /></p><p>Critical thinking</p><p><strong>a. Do you believe that the soul really exists? Write your arguments in support of your answer. </strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>The existence of the soul is a crucial philosophical question. No matter how many times \"religions\" claim it to exist, how can we be sure?</strong>&nbsp;A slew of recent scientific studies has shed light on this age-old spiritual curiosity.</p><p><br /></p><p>I believe the soul might exist because of some mysteries we cannot fully explain.</p><p><br /></p><p>The concept of a soul is connected to what happens after death and our view of the future. Some say it depends on the physical body, but others argue different.</p><p><br /></p><p>Birth and death are mysterious. During sleep or when using our imagination and memory, our consciousness acts in ways we don't fully understand. This points to something deeper inside us called a life force or soul separate from the physical.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. If you want to change your body, you first have to change your mind. Discuss.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>It's true that to change your body, you must first change the way you think. Your mindset affects your actions and goals.</p><p><br /></p><p>You will never reach your physical goals if you don't believe in your mind that you can achieve them.</p><p><br /></p><p>The way you think impacts your body. To change your shape or health, you must shift your mentality first. This shows how important it is to take care of your mind as well as your body.</p><p><br /></p><p>Having a positive mindset where you feel change is possible will motivate you to take the steps to make changes to your physique. </p><p><br /></p><p>If your thinking remains the same but you try to alter your body, it will be very difficult to succeed. Adjusting your perspectives and beliefs is the first crucial step to changing your physical self. A balanced mind and body go hand in hand.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Write critically on the given topics. </strong></p><p>a. The existence of God</p><p>Whether God exists or not has been debated for a long time. Some people strongly believe in God, while others have doubts or don't believe at all. Let's look briefly at some points in the debate:</p><p><br /></p><p>Arguments for God:</p><p>The universe needs a creator - something had to make it start. This is called the Cosmological Argument.</p><p>Things in nature like life and the universe's rules seem too complex to happen by accident. This is the Teleological Argument.</p><p>Belief in morality requires a moral lawmaker, like God. This is the Moral Argument.</p><p><br /></p><p>Arguments against God:</p><p>Bad things happen in the world, but God is said to be good. This is called the Problem of Evil.</p><p>There is no scientific proof of God. Belief is based on faith, not evidence.</p><p>Culture and upbringing shape what people believe more than logic.</p><p><br /></p><p>This is a personal question, not a proven fact. People's views depend on their experiences, backgrounds, and own thinking. No one view has convinced everyone. Believing or not believing in God's existence relies on the individual.</p><p><br /></p><p>b. Religion influences ethics and morality</p><p>The link between religion and morality or ethics is complex. Religion can guide morality, but also must be looked at carefully:</p><p><br /></p><p>Positive influences:</p><p>Religions often provide principles for right and wrong actions like honesty and kindness.</p><p>Places of worship support members and hold them responsible for moral behavior.</p><p>Religions promote justice for marginalized groups and charity.</p><p><br /></p><p>Negative aspects:</p><p>Strict religious rules may not change as societies change over time.</p><p>Differences in beliefs have caused conflicts and violence between groups.</p><p>Teachings sometimes clash with human rights like women's and LGBTQ+ rights.</p><p><br /></p><p>In conclusion, religion's effect is mixed. It can offer useful moral direction but dogma, intolerance or clashes may cause problems. The impact varies greatly depending on specific religions and interpretations. Open discussion of diverse views is needed when examining this relationship between faith and ethics.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Grammar</strong></p><p><strong>A. Rewrite the following sentences using ‘used to’. You can make an affirmative/ negative statement or a question.</strong></p><p>a. I/live in a flat when I was a child.</p><p>→ I used to live in a flat when I was a child.</p><p><br /></p><p>b. She/love eating chocolate but now she hates it.</p><p>→ She used to love eating chocolate but now she hates it.</p><p><br /></p><p>c. He/go to fishing in the summer?</p><p>→ Did he use to go fishing in the summer?</p><p><br /></p><p>d. My sister/play tennis when she was at school.</p><p>→ My sister used to play tennis when she was at school.</p><p><br /></p><p>e. He/play football every weekend?</p><p>→ Did he use to play football every weekend?</p><p><br /></p><p>f. My grandfather/speak five languages.</p><p>→ My grandfather used to speak five languages.</p><p><br /></p><p>g. I/not hate school from the beginning.</p><p>→ I did not use to hate school from the beginning.</p><p><br /></p><p>h.

He/play Dandibiyo when he was a small child.</p><p>→ He used to play Dandibiyo when he was a small child.</p><p><br /></p><p>j. She/wear a frock when she was small but nowadays she wears jeans.</p><p>→ She used to wear a frock when she was small but nowadays she wears jeans.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>B. Write a short paragraph describing your past habits.</strong></p><p>When I was a child, I used to watch TV all day, but now I stopped. I used to go to the nearest bakery shop to get freshly baked bread. My mother used to read stories to me before I went to sleep. People used to listen to the radio more often at home at that time. My mother used to clean up my room for me. But now I am a high school student and I must clean up my room by myselves.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

Swami Vivekananda, a renowned Indian spiritual leader, emphasized the existence of an eternal soul (Atma) and its unity with the Divine (Brahman). He believed in the concept of reincarnation and saw human life as an opportunity for spiritual progress and realization.</p><p><br /></p><p>We will explore the key aspects of his philosophy, including the eternal nature of the soul, the purpose of life, and the idea of reincarnation. Additionally, we will critically review these teachings, acknowledging that they are rooted in Hinduism and may not align with all belief systems. We'll emphasize the importance of respecting diverse perspectives on the nature of the soul and its immortality in our pluralistic world.</p><p><br /></p><p>Through this presentation, we aim to gain insights into Swami Vivekananda's spiritual philosophy while promoting a respectful and open-minded approach to exploring questions of the soul's eternal nature.</p><p><br /></p><p>Swami Vivekananda taught that the soul is immortal and united with God. Many Hindus find this inspiring as it gives life purpose and meaning.</p><p>However, it's from the perspective of Hinduism. Not all beliefs align with other religions or views. For example, reincarnation is not a universal idea. Different faiths have varying ideas about the soul's immortality.</p><p><br /></p><p>In our diverse world, we must respect the many rich philosophies that exist regarding the soul. Vivekananda offered one perspective among many possible spiritual paths.</p><p><br /></p><p>Individuals may explore different teachings in trying to understand the soul. No single view should claim to have the complete truth. We live in a pluralistic society, so showing appreciation for the range of beliefs others hold is important.</p><p><br /></p>"

They may act as a vital link in fostering understanding between people of different backgrounds or religions.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>g. Why should the immigrants run in concordance with global culture?</strong></p><p>→ The cost of solitude and non-convergence is greater and more harmful than integration for immigrants, therefore they should run in line with global culture.</p><p>Additionally, they will be capable of overcoming their anxiety of being anonymous.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Critical thinking</strong></p><p><strong>a. Do you think that the local is globalised and the global is localised? Can there be\\sthe global culture as well? Give examples.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Yes, I think the local and global influences each other now through globalization.</p><p><br /></p><p>Local products, media and culture have spread worldwide through technology. So the local market has become global.</p><p><br /></p><p>At the same time, people in local communities can access global goods and cultures easily. So the global is localized too.</p><p><br /></p><p>Many small local businesses benefit from reaching worldwide markets now.</p><p><br /></p><p>Areas like education, sports, music, food, fashion and language all reflect a mix of local and global influences.</p><p><br /></p><p>A true global culture is emerging too as the world becomes more connected. Things are adapted for different places but also shared between them more than before.</p><p><br /></p><p>Globalization allows local communities to be part of worldwide trends and trade. But local identities still remain an important part of the global picture. There is now a balance between local and global influences in one interconnected world culture.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. What is globalisation? Discuss the effects of globalisation on traditional cultures.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Globalization refers to how economies, cultures and populations worldwide are becoming more interconnected through trade, innovation, business and sharing of information across borders.</p><p><br /></p><p>While cultures evolve naturally over time, global influences can impact smaller, local cultures more strongly. This strains traditional ways of life.</p><p><br /></p><p>Some argue globalization makes all places more similar, with popularity of certain global trends overshadowing local traditions. Others disagree, saying diversity enhances our world.</p><p><br /></p><p>The effects are mixed. Traditional cultures must adapt to survive globally but also maintain what makes them unique. Global connections can both help spread local arts but also weaken cultural practices if overtaking them.</p><p><br /></p><p>An open exchange between global and local values seems best - where people of all cultures feel represented in an increasingly connected society. Diversity strengthens our shared humanity.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Discuss the impacts of globalisation on the process and progress of education in Nepal.</strong></p><p>Globalization has changed education in important ways in Nepal. Digital technology allows learning from home, improving access.</p><p><br /></p><p>People now have more options to study overseas due to global educational links. This benefits their career goals and skills.</p><p><br /></p><p>If provided equal opportunities, Nepalis can learn skills to participate in and contribute to today's globalized world. Education is a tool for both local progress and global cooperation.</p><p><br /></p><p>Overall globalization opens up education, giving more freedom to learn. But equal access must continue improving so all can gain powerful knowledge. Connected learning strengthens communities both within Nepal and worldwide.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Writing</strong></p><p><strong>c. &nbsp;Write a news story to be published in a newspaper about a local festival/fair of Nepal</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Kathmandu, Nepal </p><p>Baisakh 13, 2080</p><p><br /></p><p>Nepal Festival Celebrates Culture</p><p><br /></p><p>The big Nepal Festival happened this weekend in Kathmandu.

How does she describe the houses on the trails of western Nepal?</strong></p><p>→ Along the river in western Nepal, there were stone cottages built under a large rock overhang. Even though the houses looked unstable and unsafe, people still lived in them. The cottages were tucked away below the rock overhang overlooking the river.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What does she mean when she says \"I walked towards a village15 kilometres further as the crow flies?</strong>\"</p><p>→ The distance she had to travel was estimated between two points when she states \"I went towards another village, which was 15 kilometres away as the crow flies.\"</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d.

It is said that travelling to a place equals reading three books. Do you agree?&nbsp;Why?</strong></p><p>I think travelling can teach you more than reading 3 books. When you visit a place, you use all your senses to experience it directly. You see, hear, smell and feel things for yourself. This helps you understand and remember better. Reading is more passive - you only use your imagination. So travelling provides a richer learning experience. It also reduces stress and gives new perspectives which can make you a more well-rounded person.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. The author spent a five-week-long walk along the western Himalayas. Do you think it was adventurous?</strong>&nbsp;Why?</p><p>Yes, her walk along the western Himalayas seems very adventurous. She hiked difficult mountain trails and went to remote areas that are closed to most visitors. During her trip, she had to use survival skills to handle the harsh conditions. She escaped her daily routine and explored the nature and local culture. Facing challenges in an unfamiliar environment makes it an exciting adventure that refreshed her mind. Surviving in the mountains on her own for 5 weeks shows it was not an ordinary trip but a big undertaking.</p><p><br /></p><p>Writing</p><p><strong>a. Write a travelogue of your recent visit to a natural/religious place in about 300 words. Use the following clues. </strong></p><p><strong>Local costumes and traditions .... Cuisine ...Depiction of places of interest, local history and culture .... Your adventures ..... Prices and transportation ... Entertainment</strong></p><p>My recent trip took me to the beautiful city of Pokhara, Nepal. It is set between tall mountains with a large lake.</p><p><br /></p><p>When I arrived, the peaceful lake captured my attention. Gliding on its waters with mountains reflecting was beautiful.</p><p><br /></p><p>Pokhara has many religious sites. I enjoyed prayer offerings at Bindhyabasini Temple with its scenic views. The World Peace Pagoda hilltop monastery held serenity.</p><p><br /></p><p>Known for Annapurna trekking, I hiked nearby trails through forests and past waterfalls. Scenery was picturesque.</p><p><br /></p><p>Local cuisine blended Nepali and other flavors. I liked lentil soups and dumplings with warm hospitality.</p><p><br /></p><p>Transport was easy via buses and taxis to explore attractions.</p><p><br /></p><p>Evenings on the lively lakeside brought markets, cafes and music. I strolled amid prayer flags in the breeze's energy.</p><p><br /></p><p>Leaving was bittersweet having fallen for Pokhara's nature charm. Memories of mountains, lake and kindness remain in my heart. It offers tranquility, spirituality and adventure for nature lovers.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Write an essay in about 500 words on 'Importance of Tourism in Nepal'.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Tourism is one of the most important industries for Nepal's economy. The country has immense natural and cultural wealth that attracts travellers from around the world. However, tourism was severely impacted in recent years due to issues like political instability and natural disasters. It is crucial for Nepal to promote responsible tourism to realize its economic and social benefits.</p><p><br /></p><p>Nepal has incredible geographic and topographic diversity ranging from Himalayan peaks to jungle lowlands. This unique landscape offers opportunities for diverse tourism activities like trekking, mountain biking, rafting, and sightseeing. Cultural tours showcase Nepal's rich heritage through attractions like ancient temples, monasteries, and villages. Tourism provides employment and income to many local communities involved in industries like hospitality, travel, handicrafts, and tour operations. It contributes greatly to government revenue through taxes.</p><p><br /></p><p>In recent years, tourism suffered major setbacks. The 2015 earthquakes damaged tourism infrastructure and disrupted the sector. Political upheavals in earlier periods also negatively impacted visitor arrivals. The 2020 pandemic caused a drastic decline in foreign tourists. This had huge economic costs as tourism accounts for millions of jobs and around 8-10% of Nepal's GDP. Reviving tourism is crucial for economic recovery in the post-pandemic period.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sustainable tourism development must be a priority to ensure long-term benefits. Community-led initiatives can empower local people to manage cultural sites and natural areas while earning sustainable incomes. Entrepreneurship in rural homestays, local tours and experiences can boost rural livelihoods. Public-private partnerships are forming new trekking trails, improving roads and facilities in protected areas to world-class standards to enhance the tourist experience. Strict enforcement of environmental laws and monitoring activities protect scenic landscapes and biodiversity for future generations.</p><p><br /></p><p>Tourism, if developed responsibly, can drive balanced regional growth, create green jobs and boost foreign exchange. The government is working to reduce barriers and costs for foreign tourist visas. Aggressive global marketing campaigns are increasing arrivals from new markets in Asia and Europe. As travel resumes, Nepal aims to position itself as an attractive sustainable tourism destination and realize its vision of 'Visit Nepal 2020'. Revived tourism can accelerate the country's recovery from recent crises.</p><p><br /></p><p>In conclusion, tourism is pivotal for Nepal's economy and development. Responsible promotion of its diverse natural and cultural offerings can generate substantial local benefits if concerns over sustainability and community participation are simultaneously addressed. Tourism, coupled with protection of heritage, can ensure a prosperous future for Nepal.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Grammar</strong></p><p><strong>B.

Why did the author feel that she was lucky to be so naïve of her freshman year at college?</strong></p><p>Ans: When a person thinks s/he knows everything, the tendency to search for the extra knowledge starts vanishing. When we don't know anything else, we start exploring for knowledge and wisdom. Hence, she feels so lucky to be naive in her freshman year at college because being foolish, she got an opportunity to explore new things.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Why did she say that she went to college in the Stone Age?</strong></p><p>Ans: Technology was not such a use at her time. Compared to the present time, she was not so lucky to use cell phones, electronic gadgets to the fullest like her son is doing now. Seeing her son, using electronic devices and technology almost everywhere, she says that her time was so primitive, hence she said she went to college in the stone age.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What kinds of technological tools can Hayden use at his college life unlike at his mother’s time?</strong></p><p>Ans: Hayeden uses every technological shortcuts to make his living easier. Wherever it is possible, he imposes the usage of technology whether it is a small thing or big. He utilizes cell phones for exploring applications, Facebook, Twitter. Instagram, Youtube etc</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. How has the internet and social sites affected the lifestyle of the youths?</strong></p><p>Ans: Youth today rely on the internet for both big and small tasks. They can easily find information online but this reduces the need to think deeply and be creative to solve problems. Social media allows youth to connect with many people. However, they only know these people online rather than meeting in real life. So youth may feel less connected to their actual communities. Spending time online also means youth miss out on experiences of discovering the real world through activities away from screens. While digital connections are useful, an over-reliance on technology for interactions and information may discourage youth from building social skills and independent thinking in the real world. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. What things about college life will Hayden really miss unlike his mother?</strong></p><p>Ans: Unlike his mother, Hayden will miss real life interactions, usage of thinking capability and imagination, exploration and discoveries of various things in life.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. The writer says, \"I worry that students today are more connected and more fragmented\". Isn't this paradoxical?</strong>&nbsp;How?</p><p>Ans: The phrase is paradoxical because it says students are both \"more connected\" and \"more fragmented\". This seems contradictory. But it can be understood when you look more closely at the types of connection. Students are more connected through technology and social media. This allows them to link with many people online. However, their connections may not be very deep or meaningful if they are primarily digital. They could be fragmented in the sense of being disconnected from real, in-person interactions and relationships.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Critical thinking</strong></p><p><strong>a. Do you think that advancements of technology can hinder the exposure students receive in school, and block them from gaining some of life’s most memorable moments? Give reasons in support of your answer.</strong></p><p>Ans: Yes, I think advancements in technology can hinder the experiences students receive in school and prevent them from making memorable life lessons.</p><p><br /></p><p>While technology provides convenience, it can replace real-world learning if overused. Students need direct exposure to struggles, challenges, hard work and exploration to grow. Memorable moments often come from failure and persevering through difficulties.</p><p><br /></p><p>Too much technology prevents this. It keeps students from fully engaging in school by distracting them. They may not learn as effectively online versus in-person interactions.</p><p><br /></p><p>Importantly, technology can stop students from building valuable life skills like problem-solving independently, communicating face-to-face, and discovering new things through hands-on activities versus searches. These types of lessons shape people profoundly.</p><p><br /></p><p>Without balancing technology exposure, students risk missing out on the kind of rich experiences through trial and error that influence character and personal success later in life. Direct learning challenges students to think creatively and persist through challenges in meaningful ways.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Kline’s essay focuses on the contrast between her son’s freshman college experience and her own, but she also establishes what they have in common. Explain.</strong></p><p>Answers:</p><p>Kline’s essay contrasts her college experience with her son's. However, she also notes similarities - the challenges of adjusting to college life, making friends, and pursuing new knowledge remain the same. Relationships and personal development do not change despite technological advances.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Has the internet aided to broadening or narrowing the critical thinking capacity of youths or readers?</strong>&nbsp;How?</p><p>Answers:</p><p>The internet can both help and hinder people's thinking. If used to learn new things, it expands knowledge. But relying on it too much without creative thinking can limit people.</p><p><br /></p><p>Many Nepalis use the internet hoping it makes life easier. They turn to it for both small and big problems. But this means they don't build their own problem-solving skills.</p><p><br /></p><p>Some say the internet boosts thinking. It does have benefits. But we should see that many people only search online rather than think things through themselves.</p><p><br /></p><p>I think it narrows students' thinking especially. When they have homework or questions, they search online instead of figuring things out in books. The internet becomes a shortcut instead of exercising their minds.</p><p><br /></p><p>In conclusion, the internet is good for gaining information. But over-relying on it as an easy answer without independent thought can weaken people's creativity and ability to learn on their own.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Writing</strong></p><p><strong>B. Interpret the information given in the following chart.</strong></p><p>This chart shows how often people in the US ate at fast food restaurants in 2003, 2006, and 2013.</p><p><br /></p><p>Very few people (under 5%) ate fast food every day or never ate it.</p><p><br /></p><p>The most common frequencies were once a week and once-twice a month.</p><p><br /></p><p>In 2003, 31% ate fast food weekly, dropping to 27% by 2013.</p><p><br /></p><p>Eating once-twice monthly was 30% in 2003, dropping to 25% in 2006 before rising to 33% in 2013.</p><p><br /></p><p>Between 15-20% ate fast food several times a week, highest at 20% in 2006.</p><p><br /></p><p>About 15% ate fast food only a few times a year for all years.</p><p><br /></p><p>In summary, most people ate fast food weekly or monthly, with small fluctuations over the decade.

Where did the children used to play?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;&nbsp;The children used to play in a beautiful garden of the giant in the afternoon after school.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>B. What did the Snow and the Frost do to the garden?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The Snow and the Frost covered the garden with snow and ice because the giant was being selfish and rude to the children.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>C. What did the giant hear when he was lying awake in bed?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The giant heard beautiful music when he was lying awake in bed.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>D. Why do you think spring never came to the giant's garden?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;I think the spring season never came to the giant's garden because of his selfishness and his restriction on the children to play there by building the great wall.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>E. How did the giant realise his mistake?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The giant realized his mistake when he saw changes in his garden like snow and wind. He felt guilty for how he treated the children. When the children returned, the garden bloomed again with leaves and flowers and birds singing. Then he understood his mistake.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Reference to the text</strong></p><p><strong>A. Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>a. “How happy we were there!” they said to each other.</p><p><strong>i. Where does ‘there’ refer to?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;'There' refers to the giant's garden where children used to play after school.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ii. What does ‘they’ refer to?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;'They' refers to the children who used to come and play in Giant's garden after school.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iii. Why are they saying so?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;They are saying so because they aren't allowed to play in the giant's garden.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. “I have many beautiful flowers,” he said; “but the children are the most beautiful flowers of all.”</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>i. Who is the speaker?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The speaker is an old and feeble giant who keeps on watching the children at their play sitting on his armchair.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ii. Who is he speaking to?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;He is speaking to himself admiring his garden.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iii. Who are ‘the children’ that the speaker is referring to?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;'The Children' that the speaker is referring to are the small and innocent school children who enjoy a lot in the giant's garden.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Iv. Why is the speaker saying that ‘the children are the ……’ ?</strong></p><p>Answer. The speaker says 'children are the most........' because like the flowers, children also bring joy and happiness in the garden.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. When the little child smiled at the Giant, and said to him, \"You let me play once in your garden, today you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise,\" shortly afterwards, the happy giant dies. What is the coincidence of this event?&nbsp;Describe it in relation to this fairy tale.</strong></p><p>The giant spent his days searching for and waiting to see the child again. His only reason for living was to meet the enchanted little one. The little child appeared again in the garden. By this time, the giant was very old and weak. The child came to repay the giant's kindness from long ago, when he let the child play in the garden. After speaking with the child that afternoon, the giant finally passed away.</p><p><br /></p><p>The coincidence of the child reappearing highlights how love, kindness and thinking of others can transform someone. His death is not the end, but a transition to a better place. The story suggests the giant reached a peaceful state after learning empathy and making amends for past mistakes.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>B. The story makes use of personification as one of the main figures of speech. Cite three examples of personification from the story. What is the significance of the seasons personified in the story?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>The story uses personification to give human traits to non-human things. For example:</p><p><br /></p><p>\"The Spring has forgotten this garden,\" - Spring is personified as able to forget.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"The Frost painted all the trees silver.\" - Frost is personified as able to paint like an artist.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"And the tree broke at once into blossom...\" - The tree is personified as able to have emotional responses.</p><p><br /></p><p>Personifying the seasons helps convey deeper meaning. Each season represents a state of the Giant's heart and garden. Winter shows his coldness while Spring shows warmth, love and renewal. By personifying seasons, the story shows how the Giant and garden change from a winter of selfishness to a spring of kindness.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>C. This story can be read as a fairytale, where the children, the seasons, the tree, the corner of the garden, the snow, the wind and the frost are all used as symbolism. Interpret those symbols.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>The Children - Represent innocence, happiness, and potential for goodness through kindness.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Seasons (Winter, Spring, Autumn) - Represent the emotional states of the Giant and garden. Winter is selfishness, Spring is renewal and kindness.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Tree - Represents transformation as the garden changes with the Giant's change of heart.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Corner of the Garden - Where winter stays until the ultimate act of kindness, represents lingering selfishness.</p><p><br /></p><p>Snow, Frost, North Wind, Hail - Represent the harshness of selfishness and isolation, and the consequences of the Giant's actions.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Little Child - Symbolizes a divine or angelic presence, representing love, compassion, and the possibility of redemption. The child's wounds on the hands and feet are reminiscent of the crucifixion, emphasizing the theme of sacrificial love.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>D. Which figure of speech is used for ‘winter, frost, snow, north wind, hail and little child’? Who is the little child compared to?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>The figure of speech used for 'winter, frost, snow, north wind, hail, and little child' can be called both personification and metaphor.</p><p><br /></p><p>The little child is compared metaphorically to a divine or angelic being. The wounds on its hands and feet symbolize the wounds of Jesus. This comparison shows the child represents love, redemption, and spiritual change in the story.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Reference beyond text</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>a. What is the main theme of the story?</strong></p><p>→ The main theme is the power of love, kindness and selflessness to transform. It shows how a selfish cruel Giant changes through compassion for children. Kindness and love can change even cold hearts and bring renewal and happiness.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Does God punish those who are cruel to children and very selfish?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The story doesn't talk about God punishing cruelty. It focuses on self-redemption and people's ability to change their ways through kindness and love. It suggests selfishness leads to isolation but people can recognize mistakes, seek forgiveness, and redeem themselves through selfless acts. The main message is about transformation and possibility of change, not punishment.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"rewardTxt": "Read Summary",
"reward": "<p><strong>Summary&nbsp;</strong></p><p>\"The Selfish Giant\" is a story about a giant who initially restricts children from coming and playing in beautiful garden but later learns the value of kindness and love.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Once, there was a giant who had a lovely garden. Children used to play there every afternoon, enjoying the beauty of the garden with its flowers and peach trees. The birds sang beautifully, and the children were happy.</p><p><br /></p><p>The giant was gone away for seven years to visit a friend. When he returned, he was angry to find children playing in his garden. He put up a sign that said no children allowed!. All the children were sad because they couldn't play in the garden.</p><p><br /></p><p>The garden remained in winter because of the giant's selfishness. The Snow, Frost, North Wind, and Hail made it their home, and the garden stayed frozen and cold. The giant wondered why spring never came in this garden despite the season changed to spring everywhere.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>One day, the Giant hears sweet music and discovers that children have entered his garden through a hole in the wall. The trees and flowers blossom to welcome the children. He sees one small boy who couldn't reach the branches of the tree. The Giant's act of kindness in helping the boy is a important moment in the story because it was the beginning of the garden's transformation and the Giant's change of heart.</p><p><br /></p><p>However, the other children fled in fear, turning the garden back into winter. The giant was sad but continued to let the boy play there. The boy invited spring, and when the other children returned, the giant made the garden their playground.</p><p><br /></p><p>Many years passed and the giant got very old. One day, he saw the boy again but noticed marks on his hands and feet. The boy&nbsp; told the giant that those marks are the sign of love. Then, the boy took the giant to Paradise as a reward of being kind.</p><p><br /></p><p>Later, the children found the giant lying under a big tree filled with beautiful white flowers.

Where did the narrator and his servant make forcible entrance?</strong></p><p>Ans : - The narrator and servant forcefully entered a locked room they found in the abandoned chateau.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Which special picture did the narrator notice in the room?</strong></p><p>Ans : - The special picture the narrator noticed was an oval portrait.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Describe the portrait that the narrator saw in the room.</strong></p><p>Ans : - The portrait showed a beautiful young woman with long hair. She looked both alive and dead. Her features were delicate and see-through. Her eyes looked out vividly. It captured her beauty and liveliness very well.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. What is the relationship between the portrait painter and its subject?</strong></p><p>Ans: Portrait painter and its subject have a husband-and-wife relationship. The subject's (lady's) husband is an accomplished artist who created a portrait of his wife.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference to the text</p><p><strong>A.What is the story's primary theme? In the oval portrait, who is the lady depicted?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>The main idea of Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"The Oval Portrait\" is about the destructive nature of obsession and the conflict between art and life. The woman in the oval portrait is the wife of the artist. Her beauty and liveliness are important to the central theme of the story.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>B. \"The Oval Portrait\" is a short horror story by Edgar Allan Poe involving the disturbing circumstances surrounding a portrait in a chateau. Elaborate.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>\"The Oval Portrait\" is a short horror story about a portrait in an abandoned mansion. It is written in a nested story format, also called story within story format. It has two, ie. outer and inner narrative.</p><p><br /></p><p>The outer story is about a narrator and servant taking shelter in the mansion.</p><p><br /></p><p>The inner story is about an artist who becomes obsessed with painting his wife's beauty in a portrait. As he works, he doesn't see her health becoming worse. When the portrait is done, she has already died. It seems like the portrait took her life force.</p><p><br /></p><p>So the story centers around the creepy circumstances of a portrait found in an empty mansion. It shows an artist so focused on his art, he fails to help his dying wife.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>C. \"The Oval Portrait\" suggests that the woman's beauty condemns her to death. Discuss.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>\"The Oval Portrait\" shows how the woman's beauty led to her death. Her husband was so focused on sketching her looks in his painting, he neglected her existence. His drive for artistic perfection made him ignore his wife's failing health. This neglect caused her death. Though her beauty was captured forever in the portrait, it came at the price of her life.</p><p><br /></p><p>The story warns that an obsession with beauty can be dangerous if it makes someone ignore another person's welfare. The artist's passion for his art led to his wife's death because he didn't care for her well-being as she got sick. Her portrait preserved her looks but took her actual life.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>D. Discuss the story as a frame narrative (a story within a story).</strong></p><p>\"The Oval Portrait\" uses a frame narrative technique. This means there is an outer story that contains an inner story.</p><p><br /></p><p>The outer story is about a narrator and servant sheltering in a mansion. There, they find a book describing the portrait.</p><p><br /></p><p>The inner story focuses on the artist and his wife. It follows their lives and the sad events leading up to the portrait's completion.</p><p><br /></p><p>By using this frame narrative, the story has more layers. We see the events from the outside perspective of the narrator finding the book. And from the inside view of what actually happened to the artist and wife.</p><p><br /></p><p>This added depth by showing both the external discovery and internal portrayed events unfolding. The frame narrative structure provides complexity to the tale.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>E. The story is told in a descriptive style, with plenty of imagery and symbolism. Which images and symbols do you find in the story?</strong></p><p>\"The Oval Portrait\" employs a descriptive style rich in imagery and symbolism. Some of the notable images and symbols in the story include:</p><p>The oval portrait itself, which symbolizes the conflict between art and life, as well as the idea of capturing fleeting beauty.</p><p>The chateau in the Apennines, representing a decaying and isolated world.</p><p>The book within the story, serving as a narrative device and a symbol of hidden knowledge.</p><p>The woman's beauty and her portrayal in the portrait, symbolizing the artist's obsession and the cost of artistic perfection.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>F. What does the expression “She was dead!” mean?</strong></p><p>The expression \"She was dead!\" in the story signifies the moment of realization by the artist that his wife has died. It is a crucial and haunting moment in the narrative, highlighting the tragic consequences of his obsession with creating the perfect portrait, which he achieves only at the expense of her life.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p><p><strong>a. Do you think there is life in art?</strong></p><p>Ans: People have discussed for a long time whether there is \"life\" in art. Some think art can make us feel very emotional and show what life is really like. Others think art only shows life, it's not life itself. It depends on how you see art.</p><p><br /></p><p>In Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"The Oval Portrait,\" he explores the idea that art can capture how alive a person is. But it may take away their real life.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. Explain.</strong></p><p>Ans: Painting is one of the most impressive artistic mediums. The picture speaks for itself in a very direct way. Regarding painting, this statement is appropriate. As we saw in this story, when the narrator first saw the painting, he was flabbergasted. The oval picture is one of the most impressive and has taken the storyteller completely by surprise in this story as well.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Similarly, The artists put in a lot of time and effort to produce beautiful works of art that have deeper significance. Good painting makes viewers curious about both it and the painter. So, painting is one of the most admirable art.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. A more intense look at the painting reveals the illusion. Have you noticed any such painting?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans: I have not seen such a painting in real life. But I had heard a lot about the Monalisa portrait of Leonardo Da Vinchi. Around six million people each year visit to see this picture, which is protected behind bullet-proof glass at the Musée du Louvre in Paris. The proportions and measurements of the woman's body in the painting match principles of the universe. So in a way, it shows what the \"perfect\" human body should look like based on things like symmetry. That's why art experts say it's such an accurate portrait of a real person.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

A lot of things came back to him, including all the faced torture, the people who were around him when he was imprisoned (including other inmates), his old age, and the fact that he had spent 26 years in jail. He had a very unpleasant feeling of losing all dignity, power, prestige and even the respect from his family members as well as the ones from his community.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>D. Why did Makar disclose that he had killed the merchant?</strong></p><p>Makar disclosed the culprit of the merchant's murder, saying he did it because he was embarrassed of himself and he wanted to make Aksionov free from the prison. He could no longer live with the guilt. He probably felt sorry for wrongly accusing Aksionov, who was then unjustly put in prison. Makar was seeking forgiveness by admitting what he had done.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>E. Why doesn't Aksionov wish to return to his family at the end of the story?</strong></p><p>The story ends with Aksionov refusing to return to his family because he has grown old, lost all dignity, power, prestige and even the respect from his family members as well as the ones from his community. At his age, he's weak as well. He's spent his whole life behind bars despite the fact that he's never committed a crime. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Reference to the text</strong></p><p><strong>a. \"Well, old man,\" repeated the Governor, \"tell me the truth: who has been digging under the wall?</strong>\"</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>i. Who is that old man?</strong></p><p>Aksionov is that old man.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ii. Which truth is the speaker asking about?</strong></p><p>The speaker is asking about the person responsible for tunnel digging.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iii. Which wall does the speaker mean?</strong></p><p>This refers to the barricade around the jail.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>B. Describe Aksionov's character.</strong></p><p>Aksionov is a good, honest man whose habits and characters change a lot in the story. At first, he is a happy young man who likes singing and drinking with friends. Sometimes he gets wild too. After he gets married, he changes his habits. He stops drinking and becomes a caring husband and father. When he is wrongly put in prison, he stays very patient and strong. Through it all, he is kind and forgiving. Despite facing significant hardship, Aksionov follows the virtues of kindness, honesty and inner strength that define his character in a positive light throughout the story. He transforms from a carefree youth to a man of strong moral principles.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>C. What is the theme of the story?</strong></p><p>The story's major themes are justice, innocence, and forgiveness. It shows what happens when someone is wrongly accused. It also shows how guilt and forgiveness can affect people for a long time. The story shows how forgiveness can change people and situations. Even when things are very hard, people can find redemption (being saved from wrong acts) and get better through forgiveness.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>D. Which symbols are used in the story and what do they indicate?</strong></p><p>Several symbols are used in the story:</p><p><br /></p><p>The Grey Hair: Aksionov's wife's dream of his hair turning gray symbolizes the suffering and hardship he will endure due to false accusations.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Knife: The blood-stained knife found in Aksionov's bag symbolizes the false evidence that leads to his unjust imprisonment. It is also a symbol of guilt and the burden of a crime committed by Makar.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Tunnel: The tunnel that Makar Semyonich digs under the prison wall symbolizes both escape and confession. It represents the potential for redemption and the release of the truth.</p><p><br /></p><p>Aksionov's Chains: The physical chains Aksionov wears in prison also symbolize the burden of guilt and injustice that he carries. They serve as a reminder of his wrongful conviction and suffering.</p><p><br /></p><p>Prayer and Faith: Aksionov's deep faith and prayer symbolize his spiritual journey and transformation. His prayers become a source of strength and forgiveness, ultimately leading to his inner peace.</p><p><br /></p><p>These symbols collectively convey the story's themes of justice, innocence, redemption, and the transformative power of forgiveness.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>a. How does he undergo a spiritual transformation in the story? What role does religion play in Aksionov's life?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Religion is very important in Aksionov's life. At first, he likes to drink and have fun. But after marriage, he changes because of his Christian beliefs. He stops drinking and follows God's rules to be good. When in jail for a crime he didn't do, prayer to God help him feel better. Even when he learns who really did the crime, Aksionov forgives that person. This shows what Christianity taught him about forgiveness. Over many years in jail, Aksionov becomes very wise, kind and helpful. Other prisoners call him \"The Saint\". His faith makes him strong inside even in hard times. Aksionov accepts what happens to him because he believes only God can judge him. The story shows how religion guides Aksionov and changes him from happy but careless to peaceful even with big problems. His faith, prayer and forgiveness help him through difficulties.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>B. What does the story tell us about the existence of an unfair system of justice?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>The story criticizes an unfair system where innocent people can be wrongly punished due to social class differences, lack of care in investigations and no opportunity to correct mistakes. A good system must protect all people equally before the law.</p><p><br /></p><p>An innocent man named Aksionov goes to jail for a crime he did not do. This should not happen. Aksionov does not have powerful friends to help him. The real criminal gets away because he is from a rich family. Aksionov is found guilty based on little evidence. They do not try hard to find the real truth. Aksionov spends over 20 years in jail but they do not give him a fair second trial to prove his innocence.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>In the town of Vladimir, there lived a young merchant named Ivan Dmitrich Aksionov. He had two shops and a house of his own. Aksionov was a cheerful man, fond of singing, but he had a past of drinking and recklessness, which changed after he got married.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>One summer, he was heading to the Nizhny Fair. His wife dreamed he'd return with grey hair, but he left anyway. As he traveled, he met a fellow merchant, spent the night at an inn, and continued his journey early morning.</p><p><br /></p><p>After going little far, an official and two soldiers approached Aksionov with questions where he was, why did he leave the hotel earlier etc. They accused him of murdering a merchant who had been found dead with his throat cut, the same merchant he shared the same room the previous night.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Aksionov was shocked and denied any involvement. However, a bloody knife was found in his bag, and his early leaving of the hotel made him seem guilty. He was arrested and put in jail.</p><p><br /></p><p>His wife and children visited him in prison. His wife believed he was innocent. Aksionov was sentenced to hard labor in Siberia. He spent 26 years there. His hair turned white during that time. He lived religiously. He learned how to make boots and earned a little money. He bought a book about saints' lives. The other prisoners respected him. They called him \"Grandfather\" and \"The Saint\".</p><p><br /></p><p>One day, a new group of prisoners came. One man, named Makar Semyonich, seemed familiar to Aksionov. After talking, Aksionov realized Makar was probably the real killer. He found out Makar had dug a tunnel to escape. Aksionov thought about telling the authorities but decided not to. He left it up to God's will.</p><p><br /></p><p>Later, the tunnel was found. The Governor asked Aksionov to identify who dug it. But Aksionov refused to know that. That night, Makar told Aksionov he really did kill the merchant and set up Aksionov. He begged for forgiveness. But Aksionov had already suffered too much at that point of time.</p><p><br /></p><p>Makar eventually told the authorities what he did. But by then, Aksionov had already died. He passed away before the order came to release him.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Themes</b></p><p>Injustice: The story shows that Aksionov was accused of a murder he did not do. This was unfair. It teaches that good people can get into trouble because the legal system can make mistakes.</p><p><br /></p><p>Forgiveness: Forgiving others is a big theme. Aksionov forgave the man who got him into trouble. This followed the religious rule of forgiving enemies. His forgiveness helped him feel better spiritually.</p><p><br /></p><p>Being Good Again: Aksionov changed from feeling sad and angry into a kind and religious man. His hard times and new faith made this possible.</p><p><br /></p><p>God's Justice: The title \"God Sees the Truth, But Waits\" means that God's justice may not be quick, but will come surely one day. Aksionov's strong belief in God and truth helped him a lot.</p><p><br /></p><p>Inner Strength: Aksionov's journey showed how people can be strong inside. Even through hard times, inner strength can help people get through difficulties.</p><p><br /></p><p>Overall, the story teaches about important things like forgiveness, faith, believing in final divine justice, even when life is unfair.

What kind of effect did the carpet have on the child?</strong>&nbsp;.</p><p>Ans: At first, the child paid little attention to the colorful carpet. But as he challenged himself to walk on it without stepping on certain patterns, the colors seemed to get brighter and more amazing. The carpet became both fascinating and scary.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What was he afraid of while walking across the carpet?</strong></p><p>Ans: he boy was afraid to touch the black and red parts of the carpet, imagining them as harmful. In his mind, the black was like poisonous snakes while the red resembled burning coal. He believed touching them would lead to trouble.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. What motivated and encouraged the child to start and continue on his journey?</strong></p><p>Ans: What motivated the child's journey on the carpet was the promise of a puppy for his birthday if he made it across without stepping on the black and red areas. This goal motivated him to take on the difficult task.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. What did the child see as he looked down on the black patterns of the carpet?</strong></p><p>Ans: As the boy looked down at the black patterns, he pictured snakes like adders and cobras lying there. His worries about the snakes increased his anxiety on his carpet crossing.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference to the text</p><p><strong>a. The writer creates two voices in the story. Who are they?</strong></p><p>Ans: IIn the story, the writer uses two different voices or points of view. One voice tells what the child is doing from the outside. This voice sees and tells everything that is happening to the child.</p><p><br /></p><p>The other voice comes from inside the child. We hear what the child is thinking, feeling and imagining in his head. This inside voice shows us what the child is scared of, what pictures are in his mind, and how he uses his imagination.</p><p><br /></p><p>By using both voices, the reader understands both what the child is doing physically, and also what is going on in his feelings and dreams. We see his actions and movements, but also what is happening inside his head and heart. This gives us a full picture of the child's experience.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow.</strong></p><p>Ans:</p><p><strong>i. What does ‘the black part’ mean?</strong></p><p>'The black part' indicates venomous snakes.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ii.

Why doesn’t the speaker want to be burnt?</strong></p><p>The speaker wouldn't want to be burnt because he want to get a puppy the next day for his birthday.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Which images and metaphors are used in the story?</strong></p><p>Ans : The story \"The Wish\" uses several images and metaphors to convey the child's vivid imagination and fear. These include:</p><p><br /></p><p>The scab on the child's knee, which becomes a source of fascination and challenge.</p><p>The carpet's colors, with red parts representing hot coals and black parts symbolizing poisonous snakes.</p><p>The child's comparison of the carpet to a journey filled with dangers, which serves as a metaphor for his imaginative play.</p><p>The child's fear of touching the black parts of the carpet, which symbolize danger and potential harm.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Summarise the short story “The Wish” in about 200 words.</strong></p><p>Ans : The story is about a boy playing on a big carpet in his home. In his imagination, the carpet becomes a challenging journey he must take. There are different colored areas on the carpet that represent dangers. The black spots are snakes while the red spots are hot coals. The boy's goal is to walk all the way across the carpet without touching these dangerous spots. He believes that if he succeeds, he will get his wish - a puppy for his upcoming birthday. As he goes, he feels scared but keeps trying because he wants his wish to come true. In the end, he accidentally touches one of the black spots, which meant snakes in his imagination. This makes him cry because he failed his challenge. The last part shows his mother looking for him outside, showing the story ended his imaginative play on the carpet.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. The story shows the events through the eyes of the narrator and the child. Comparing the two styles, who presents a more interesting or effective view for the readers?</strong>&nbsp;Why?</p><p><br /></p><p>Ans :  The story uses two views - the narrator's and the child's. The narrator objectively tells what the child does and what the carpet looks like. This gives basic details. But it is the child's point of view that makes the story more interesting. We see through his eyes. The child imagines the carpet differently - the colors mean dangers in his fantasy journey. We also experience what he thinks and feels inside - his fears, dreams, and desire to succeed. This helps readers understand how the child sees his playtime adventure. It adds more layers and depth beyond just surface details. Because of this insight into the child's perspectives and emotions, readers can connect with him more. It draws us deeper into the story. So while the narrator provides facts, the child's subjective view is more engaging and effective at getting readers invested in the story.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. Is “The Wish” a story about self-confidence overcoming fear or about greed?</strong>Give your arguments.</p><p>Ans: One theme is about being brave and confident even when scared. The boy keeps trying to cross despite feeling afraid. He is determined to complete the challenge to make his wish of a puppy come true. This shows courage over fear. However, the story also hints at the theme of greed or wanting too much. His strong desire for the puppy makes him willing to take the risk of touching the dangerous parts. This suggests greed can lead to doing dangerous things just to get what you want. So it's also a warning about how desire and greed may cause problems if it pushes someone to act reckless. Overall the boy learns an lesson about balancing courage with caution, and not letting wants override safety. So in summary, it addresses the themes of facing fears but also has a cautionary message about not letting greed motivate risky behavior.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference beyond the text</p><p><strong>a. Do you think our wish can be fulfilled? Why or why not?</strong></p><p>Ans: Whether a wish comes true depends on different things. It depends on what the wish is, how hard you try, and things outside of your control. Some wishes you can achieve if you work really hard and don't give up. But some wishes may just not be possible no matter what due to things you can't change. Having faith that your wish could happen and actually doing things to try to make it real can help it come true. The more you believe in your wish and take real actions instead of just wishing, the better chance it has of working out. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Why do you think some people might have a frightening nature? What would you suggest to them to overcome it?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans: Some people act scared a lot because of things that happened before, feelings of not being good enough, or who they are. To help them not be so scared, they need support, kindness, and praise from others. It can also help for them to think about why they get scared and where it comes from. Talking to a counselor or therapist can help figure out what causes the scary feelings and find better ways to deal with being afraid. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Write a folktale that you have heard or read.</strong></p><p>Ans : Story: The limit of Greed ( Lobhko Sima )</p><p><br /></p><p>There was an old couple who lived in a village. They were very poor. One day, the old man wanted to eat sel rotis. They each went to collect ingredients - rice and oil. The woman cooked 5 sel rotis. They started arguing over who would eat more - 2 or 3 rotis. They couldn't agree so the man said they should sleep and whoever woke up first would eat 2 rotis. Neither of them woke up, scared of only getting 2 rotis. They slept for 3 days. Villagers thought they died. Took the bodies to cremate them. As the man was on the pyre, the fire woke him up. He said he'd eat 2 rotis. The woman also woke up laughing, saying she'd eat 3. Villagers were shocked and afraid to see the \"corpses\" arguing thinking they are ghost! It's a funny story about an old couple arguing so much they slept for 3 days, scaring the village.</p><p><br /></p><p>@Shriram Lamichhane</p><p>Get more notes from : www.tsz.com.np</p><p>Subscribe “The SR Zone” on YouTube</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",

"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>The story relies heavily on a small boy's active imagination. He transforms the simple carpet into a complex landscape filled with danger. This reflects how children perceive the world in more magnified, fanciful terms.</p><p><br /></p><p>The story is told from the point of view of a young boy. At the start, he is sitting on the stairs looking at a scab on his knee. He manages to take the scab off in one piece. He looks at it closely and then flicks it onto the big carpet in the hallway.</p><p><br /></p><p>The carpet is very big, stretching along the whole hallway. When the boy looks at it more, he imagines some things about it that scare him. He thinks the red parts will burn him like hot coals. And the black parts have poison snakes that will bite if he touches.</p><p><br /></p><p>But the boy thinks if he can walk on the yellow parts without touching red or black, he will get a puppy for his birthday the next day.

    "story": "<p><strong>Civil peace</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Written by The SR Zone | Shriram Lamichhane</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Understanding the text</strong></p><p><strong>Answer the following questions</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>a. Why did Jonathan think of himself as 'extraordinarily lucky'?</strong></p><p>Ans: onathan considered himself \"extraordinarily lucky\" because he had survived the war with his life and the lives of his wife and three out of four children intact. Additionally, he had also managed to retain his old bicycle, which was valuable to him.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. What are the ‘five blessings’ for which Jonathan is grateful?</strong></p><p>Ans: The \"five blessings\" for which Jonathan is grateful are as follows:</p><p><br /></p><p>His own head</p><p>His wife Maria's head</p><p>The heads of three out of their four children</p><p>His old bicycle</p><p>His little house in Ogui Overside</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Why did Jonathan mistrust the officer who wanted to take his bicycle?&nbsp;What does this tell you about the situation in Nigeria?</strong></p><p>Ans: Jonathan did not trust the soldier who wanted to take his bicycle. The way the soldier looked and acted made Jonathan think something was not right.</p><p><br /></p><p>The soldier's clothes were messy. His shoes did not match. The badges on his uniform looked drawn in quickly. All these things made Jonathan wonder if the soldier was really a real soldier. He thought the soldier might be pretending or trying to trick him.</p><p><br /></p><p>This shows what it was like during the war in Nigeria. Things were chaotic and confusing. People had to be careful because there could be scams or people abusing their power. You couldn't always tell who to trust. So Jonathan wanted to make sure before giving up his bicycle.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. What visitors might be at the door? Are Jonathan and his wife completely surprised? Explain.</strong></p><p>Ans: The people who are knocking on their door are robbers. The thief demands £100. Jonathan claims that he only has 20 pounds. The leader of thieves makes the decision to take the price in this case. Jonathan hands it over to him, and the thieves go away.</p><p><br /></p><p>They had heard the neighborhood noises die down, and the night watchman's routine had been disrupted earlier.&nbsp;So these things probably made Jonathan and his wife feel unsure and worried about possible problems or people coming over. While it still surprised them, they had sensed trouble might be brewing.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. Why does no one in the neighbourhood respond when the thieves pound on Jonathan’s door?&nbsp;Why do the thieves call for the police?</strong></p><p>Ans: When robbers pound at Jonathan's door, nobody in the neighbourhood responds because they're also afraid of the thieves. Thieves are calling on the cops to enjoy and mock Jonathan and his family because they know nobody will help them.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Reference to the text</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>a. What does Jonathan mean by his expression “Nothing puzzles God”?&nbsp;What does this expression reveal about his character? Explain by citing details from the story.</strong></p><p>Ans : When Jonathan says \"Nothing puzzles God\", he means that God's plans are too hard for people to understand. Even when things are hard or don't make sense, Jonathan believes God is in control. This shows Jonathan has strong faith. Even with the troubles of the war and after, he keeps believing in God. His faith gives him power and helps him deal with problems. Faith helps him feel God has a reason for everything, which gives him strength.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. How does Jonathan change as he experiences the conflicts in his life?</strong>&nbsp;Explain.</p><p>Ans : In the beginning, Jonathan values his family's safety after the hardships of war. He works hard and is smart about using money, like paying a lot to get his bike back for transportation.</p><p><br /></p><p>When thieves demand money, Jonathan at first refuses due to his principles. But when they threaten his family, he agrees to give them some money he received. This shows he is practical and will compromise to keep his family safe.</p><p><br /></p><p>Throughout the story, Jonathan faces many challenges after the war. But he stays faithful in God and adapts to changes. He uses his abilities and is willing to make tough choices to care for his wife and children. His strong commitment to his family helps him handle difficulties in post-war life.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Read the extract and answer the questions below.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>i. Who's that speaker?</strong></p><p>The speaker is Jonathan.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ii. Who speaks to the speaker?</strong></p><p>The speaker speaks to himself.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iii. Who refers to \"they?</strong>\"</p><p>\"They\" refers to treasury officials.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Nigerian English has words like soja 'soldier' and katakata 'confusion', 'trouble' derived apparently from English words but transformed by native languages' phonologies. What does the author’s use of dialect here add to the story?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans : The author uses the unique way people speak English in Nigeria in the story. This makes the story feel more real and detailed. It helps readers picture being in Nigeria. Words and phrases like \"soja\" and \"katakata\" show the local language and culture. These dialect words give the story a sense of place and identity from that region. The dialect crafts a stronger sense of place and immerses readers more fully in the post-colonial Nigerian context of the narrative.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. Why do you think the thieves who come to rob Jonathan speak English with a heavier African accent than Jonathan does?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans : The thieves may speak English with a stronger African accent than Jonathan because they came from a less privileged background with less schooling. Jonathan however may have had some formal education and experience talking to many people during his mining work. So his English seems less accented compared to the thieves. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. The title of the story \"Civil Peace\" itself is ironic as there is little to differentiate ‘civil peace’ from ‘civil war’. Do you think that the title of this story is appropriate, or would “Civil War” have been a better title?</strong>&nbsp;Explain.</p><p><br /></p><p>Ans : The title \"Civil Peace\" is ironic because it suggests peace but the story shows a difficult reality. Although the war is over, Nigeria still faces problems like crime, corruption and poverty as shown in the story. So while it's the time after war, the characters' lives are far from peaceful. The title also hints that the characters are resilient and keep trying to rebuild despite difficulties from war's effects. \"Civil War\" would be a more direct title but doesn't capture this message of hope. \"Civil Peace\" fits better as it encapsulates both the challenges they face and their determination to continue on. So the title irony highlights the contrast between the ideal of peace and the real struggles, but also the spirit of moving forward.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Reference Beyond Text</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>a. How would you describe the civil peace in Nigeria?</strong></p><p>Ans: The story shows that Nigeria's peace after the civil war is delicate and unsure. While fighting officially stopped, the country still struggled with war's impact. Problems like corruption, crime and poverty remained. People like Jonathan had to deal with these issues as they tried to move on. The peace was more about coping with challenges than true calmness. Life was hard as Nigeria recovered from such a divisive war. The story portrays this time as one of resilience, not real tranquility. It highlights how fragile the civil peace really was.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. What kind of attitude towards life do you think you would have if your situation was similar to that of Jonathan’s?</strong></p><p>Ans: I'd try to stay away from places where there's a lot of violence. I'd make every effort to retain faith in God for the sake of my family's well-being by working hard. In fact, my outlook on life and family would be similar if my circumstances were the same as Jonathan's.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Draw the character sketch of Jonathan Iwegbu.</strong></p><p>Ans: Jonathan goes through very hard times after the war in Nigeria. But he doesn't give up. He works hard to take care of his family. Even when things are difficult, he stays strong and keeps trying new things so he can make money. Jonathan also thinks of creative solutions. When he can't do one job anymore, he finds other work like driving a bicycle taxi or opening a small bar. Family means everything to Jonathan. He does his best to provide for his wife and kids. Being a good husband and dad is very important to him. He believes that things will get better in the future. He switches jobs like being a coal miner, then a taxi driver, and then owning a bar. </p><p><br /></p><p>Overall, Jonathan works very hard and stays hopeful. He overcomes challenges through courage, clever ideas, and caring for his loved ones. Jonathan shows that people can get through hard times with strength and heart.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>The story takes place in Nigeria after the war. The main character Jonathan is thankful to God that he survived the war with his wife Maria and three of their four children. He really likes his old bicycle because it is valuable to him.</p><p><br /></p><p>Jonathan is very religious. He believes in prayer and faith in God. He thinks God was watching over him during the war and helped him and his family survive the war and also to get his bicycle and house back. He believes nothing confuses God.</p><p><br /></p><p>During the war, a soldier took Jonathan's bicycle. He had to pay an army soldier two pounds to get his bicycle back. The soldier had taken it to use for \"important military work\". This shows how hard things were during the war. Jonathan having to bribe the soldier also shows his determination to get his bicycle back. He buried the bicycle to keep it safe and dug it up after the war.</p><p><br /></p><p>Jonathan and his family went back to their small mud house in Enugu. The house was still standing but had no doors, windows or roof. They fixed it up and moved back in. To make money, Jonathan started taxi service with his bicycle.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>He later ran a palm wine bar. His children picked mangoes to sell to soldiers' wives. His wife Maria made breakfast snacks called akara balls for neighbors. Together they made a little bit of money. Jonathan sometimes went to his old job at the Coal Corporation to see if he could work again. But there was still uncertainty about getting job.</p><p><br /></p><p>One day, Jonathan got a payment of twenty pounds as ex-gratia ( the term \"ex-gratia\" generally refers to a payment made by a government or organization as a gesture of goodwill or sympathy, often in cases where there may not be a legal obligation to provide compensation). He hid the money in his pocket and hurried home.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>That night, thieves came and demanded money while knocking on his door demanding for one hundred pounds. Scared, he first said no but he only had the twenty pounds so he reluctantly handed it over. After that, Jonathan accepted what happened and said nothing puzzles God. He kept living his life, seeing the lost money as small compared to what he and his family went through during and after the war.</p><p><br /></p><p>The story explores themes of survival, strength and how unpredictable life can be after a war. Jonathan's ability to adapt to challenges and see material things as not important shows the human spirit in difficult times.</p><p><br /></p><p>It is clear from how he handles problems that he stays positive. Even though he and his family face many hard times, he has hope and tries to make the best of things. This optimism is shown in starting a small business, opening a bar, and doing different work to help his family.</p><p><br /></p><p>Jonathan's character shows the theme of being strong and having faith during tough times. This central theme is important in the story.</p><p><br /></p>"

    "story": "<p><b>An astrologer’s day</b></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Done by Shriram Lamichhane</p> <p>For more notes and solution: Subscribe The SR Zone on YouTube</p> <p><br /></p><p><b>Understanding the text</b></p> <p>Answer the following Questions</p> <p><b>a. How does the astrologer’s appearance help him attract customers? How does he help the customers satisfy their needs?</b></p> <p>Ans: The astrologer of this story is dressed in such a way that everyone falls in his trap and believes him to be a legit fortune teller. He wears a saffron turban along with holy ash and vermilion glisten on his forehead. He's so well-presented that he's a crowd-pleaser. His customers believe his eyes have a prophetic light. He assists customers in meeting their needs by analysing issues such as marriage, money, and so on.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>b. How do you characterise the astrologer’s attitude toward the stranger?</b></p> <p>Ans: The astrologer notices the stranger in front of him and considers him a possible customer.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>c. What details does the astrologer give the stranger about his past?</b></p> <p>Ans: The astrologer tells the stranger that he was stabbed with a knife and pushed to death, but that some locals saw him and saved him.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>d. Why does he advise the stranger to go home immediately?</b></p> <p>Ans: He advises the stranger to go home because his revenge is then worthless as the culprit who stabbed him with a knife had already died in an accident and there is no point in staying there in search of that person and also to avoid an impending danger. In reality, he advises him in order to avoid harm to himself because he was the one who did all that action in the past..</p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>e. What is your reaction to the conversation between the astrologer and his wife?</b></p> <p>Ans: I am both satisfied and astonished with their conversation. I was astonished to know the astrologer’s reality and his past and satisfied to know that he was not guilty of murder. I am happy that the astrologer's whole collection of coins is just enough to keep them alive for the next day because he earns some more cash that day. The main thing is that the Astrologer was able to get rid of his embarrassment.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Visit: www.tsz.com.np for more!</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Reference to the text</p> <p><b>a. Suspense is the feeling of anticipation you may have as you read. In this story, what details contributed to your feelings of suspense and surprise?</b> Explain.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ans: In my case, concerns about the astrologer's own and past lives create suspense in the story. The readers are horrified to discover at the end of the story that the astrologer was the one who stabbed the stranger and left him to die while intoxicated when he was a young guy. In reality, the astrologer was not supposed to be an astrologer by his will. He left his town without any previous planning. This piques the reader's curiosity in why he broke the ancestral cycle and had to leave his home so abruptly. The stranger's encounter with the astrologer adds more suspense in the story.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>b. Analyze the conflicts in “An Astrologer’s Day.” Explain how the conflicts are resolved and what they reveal about the characters involved in the story</b></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ans: Conflict occurs in the story when the stranger challenges the astrologer to specifically answer his questions when the astrologer has packed his items and is prepared to go home. The story becomes tense as the stranger was not going to be convinced with all his usual way of dealing with customers. The astrologer feels uneasy as the stranger lights up his cheroot and sees his face through the light, so he declines the challenge for unknown reasons.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>He is compelled to say something to the stranger in order to appease him. The astrologer seemed to know everything about Guru Nayak's background, even his name.The stranger is surprised by the astrologer's description of his previous life and decides to abandon his search for an adversary who claims to have been crushed by a truck. However, this revelation was only made possible by reading between the lines of an astrologer's chat with his wife, in which it was revealed that the astrologer himself had attempted to assassinate Guru Nayak while drunk.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>c. “All right. I will speak. But will you give me a rupee if what I say is convincing?</b> Otherwise I will not open my mouth, and you may do what you like.”</p> <p><b>i. Who's that speaker?</b></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>ii. Who does he talk to?</b></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>iii. What does \"open my mouth\" mean?</b></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ans:</p> <p>i. The speaker is the astrologer.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>ii. He's talking to Nayak Guru.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>iii. Open Lips means to state anything convincing regarding the stranger.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>d. Description helps readers visualize what is happening in a story. What details and techniques does the author use to describe the astrologer?</b></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Ans: Author has given details to each and every scene, to make them more visually appealing to the readers to develop the feeling of suspense and enjoyment in this story. The story takes place in Town Hall Park late at night. The reader learns that the astrologer usually spends his time under the tamarind tree about noon. The use of dialogue throughout the story is intended to offer a variety of viewpoints while maintaining the narrator's overall authority.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>In a densely populated urban setting, the astrologer is able to establish a new identity and live via his brain. He knows how to showcase and fascinate people, despite the fact that he has no spiritual knowledge. He and his family are alive because of his knowledge. Despite his intelligence, he is bold and driven. He's a loving spouse and father. Such descriptions and micro details assist readers like us to make a more familiar image of the astrologer.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>e. Irony is a contrast between appearances and reality. What is ironic about Guru Nayak’s meeting with the astrologer?</b></p> <p>Ans:</p> <p>The encounter with the astrologer and Guru Nayak is the irony of the story. He seeks the astrologer's assistance in locating the man who tried to kill him while he was in the village some years ago. When the astrologer learns about the man, he becomes quite uncomfortable. Guru Nayak, after seeing his face recognized him and he knew that himself was the culprit of his attempt of murder. The astrologer, on the other hand, skillfully misinforms him. He makes Guru Nayak wait and haggle for money. Finally, he holds Guru Nayak in his hand when he addresses the almighty by name and tells him of the happenings in the village. Finally, hearing the (guilty) astrologer's predictions makes Guru Nayak happy. In this scene, both men are happy.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>So, as the definition states, the appearances and reality of the astrologer serve as a major irony in this story.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>f. How does the astrologer’s manner of dress suit his character?</b></p> <p>Ans: The astrologer is the story's lead character. The clothes he wears and the way he seems fit his character well, making him the centre of attention. He wears a saffron turban around his head and vermilion ash glistens on his forehead. He has a sharp mind with his own set of tricks for getting the job done. He's got a good grasp of humanity's issues which help him guess the people’s fortune despite his total lack of astrology. Even people believe him to be a legit astrologer.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Visit: www.tsz.com.np for more!</p> <p><br /></p> <p>Reference beyond the text</p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>a. The astrologer attracts many customers in the street who are pleased and astonished by what he tells them. What does this tell you about the people of the town walking in the street?</b>.</p> <p>Ans :</p> <p>The main character of this story is an astrologer who misuses the general tendency of human beings to be curious about their future. His saffron-colored hat, vermilion ash on forehead and attire help him to attract customers. His astrological equipment, clothes, and tricky predictions are all he has to rely on to run his business. The way he's dressed makes him seem to be a skilled astrologer, which pleases his customers. He's an apparent expert astrologer who knows a lot about the subject matters that take place in people's lives. This tells that the people of the town are very curious to know about their future who will blindly follow and believe in prophecies without even trying to know the reality.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>b. Why do most people want to know their future? Do you think astrologers can really help them know their future?</b></p> <p>Ans : Most people would want to know what their future holds because they are concerned about a variety of things, including their happiness, their ability to cope with challenges, study, marriage, relationships and their safety. True astrologers who have a thorough knowledge of astrology can help their clients know about their future.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><b>c. Is astrology a good practice of fortune telling or is it just a blind faith?</b> Give reasons.</p> <p>Ans : The use of astrology as a tool for fortune telling is actually true when an astrologer really holds the expert knowledge of planets and all astrology studies. Astrology states that the position of planets of a specific individual actually have some impact on what they have to endure with, what their nature is and what their future will be. It is said to account for the majority of human activities. In Eastern civilizations, most people practise or believe in astrology to discover the appropriate answers to their issues. In many instances, astrological predictions are also shown to be accurate. So, I would not prefer to call it a blind faith.</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p> <p>Get more notes from : www.tsz.com.np</p> <p>Subscribe “The SR Zone” on YouTube</p> <p>@Shriram Lamichhane</p>",

"reward": "<p><b>Summary</b></p><p>An Astrologer's day is a mystery and satirical story written by R.K. Narayan. It is the story of a man who didn't know anything about astrology or reading palms. He was a criminal who was pretending to be an astrologer who left his village and went to a far town after stabbing and pushing a young man into a well. He pretended to be an astrologer to get away from the police and make a living.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The Astrologer used to sit beneath a large tree with his instruments of the profession, such as shells, calendars, and a journal. To demonstrate knowledge and spiritual power, he used to put on clothes to look like a holy man. He put holy ash and vermilion on his forehead and wore a turban that was the color of saffron. So, he pretended to be a great palm reader, even though he never wanted to be an astrologer. He became a palm reader by accident. He had no choice but to go into this line of work. The astrologer had established his shop in a crowded market amid vendors selling low-quality food.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The astrologer's spiritual quality was heightened by the marketplace's different store lights. He didn't have his own light, so he had to rely on the other sellers'. He had no desire to become an astrologer, but he was forced to leave his family home and go far away without a plan or money. He was, nevertheless, a believable holy man, offering imprecise but soothing guidance to people in the market based on his own insights into human issues. He was an expert in his field, and he always told people what they wanted to hear. He didn't know much about astrology, but he could make a decent living.</p><p><br /></p><p>Guru Nayak showed up one day just as he was about to gather his goods and go. Neither of them could see much of the other's face in the dim light. The astrologer, seeing a chance for another customer, asked the visitor to sit and talk. The visitor agreed, but he was suspicious about the astrologer. He assured the astrologer that he couldn't provide him any useful or accurate information. The astrologer agreed after they haggled over the price (Guru Nayak would pay the astrologer eight annas if he was pleased and should refund the money twice if he wasn't).&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The astrologer was terrified when Guru Nayak lit the cigarette and saw his face. He attempted to back out of the deal, but Guru Nayak wouldn't allow him. Guru Nayak learned that the astrologer had been stabbed in the chest and left for dead. Guru Nayak was shocked by the astrologer's recognition of his name. He inquired of the astrologer as to where he might locate the assassin. He was murdered by a vehicle some months ago, according to the astrologer. Guru Nayak was irritated by this, but he was pleased that the assassin had died horribly and so he handed over the money.</p><p><br /></p><p>As he laid down to sleep at home, the astrologer told his wife about a time when he stabbed a guy and left him for dead, forcing him to abandon his home and start a new life as a fake astrologer. He had believed himself to be a murderer, yet the guy was still alive. Then he went to sleep with a smile on his face.</p><div><br /></div>"

Corona wanted to show humans how polluted the air is and how caged animals feel.

Though they are departing temporarily, he vows to return to his love, no matter how far he has to travel.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>D. Literary devices are tools that enable the writers to present their ideas, emotions and feelings and also help the readers understand those more profound meanings. Analyze the poem in terms of the literary devices such as simile, symbolism, imagery, alliteration and assonance.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans: Robert Burns has used some literary elements in this poem to show the beauty of the beloved and the intensity of his love. The analysis of some of the literary devices used in this poem has been listed below.</p><p><br /></p><p>Assonance: Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in the same line such as the sound of lilin \"I will love thee still, my dear\".</p><p><br /></p><p>Simile: There are two similes used in this poem. The first is used in the first line, \"O my Luve is like a red, red rose“ Here, the poet compares his beloved with a red rose. The second is used in the third line, \"O my Luve is like the melody\", and the poet compares his love with sweet melody.</p><p><br /></p><p>Symbolism: Symbolism means to use symbols to signify ideas and qualities, giving them symbolic meanings different from their literal meanings. Robert has used \"rose\" as a symbol of love.</p><p><br /></p><p>Alliteration: Alliteration is the repetition of consonant sounds in the same line such as the</p><p>sounds of 1/ and /r/in \"O my Luve is like a red, red rose\".</p><p><br /></p><p>Imagery: Imagery is a distinct representation of something that can be experienced or understood through five senses. Robert has used visual imagery in the poem such as, \"O my Luve is like a red, red rose\",\" And the rocks melt wi' the sun\".</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. What is hyperbole? Explain its purpose citing examples of hyperbole used in the poem.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ans; Hyperbole is a device used to exaggerate a statement for the sake of emphasis. The poet has used hyperbole in the last line of the second stanza, \"Till a' the seas gang dry.\" He says that his love will flow even when the seas dry up. The second is used in the third stanza, \"And the rocks melt wi' the sun.\"</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. What is a refrain? Why is it used in the poem?Explain citing an example from the poem.</strong></p><p>Ans; The lines that are repeated again at some distance in the poems are called refrain. The line, \"And I will luve thee still, my dear\" has become a refrain, as it has been repeated in second and the third stanzas.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference Beyond Text</p><p><strong>a. What kind of love is expressed in a red red rose poem?</strong></p><p>Ans; Robert Burns is expressing romantic love in \"A Red, Red Rose.\" As the poem's title indicates, he is at the height of being head-over-heels in love.

Do you believe that love has power?</strong></p><p>Yes, I believe that love has power and the power of love is so influential. Love is a very strong thing and the power of love can pull down a relationship and can as well build up the same; it all depends on what influence it has to offer whether negatively or positively. Love has the power to heal the invisible wounds.</p><p><br /></p><p>The poets compose the poems addressing their beloved because they feel the poem by placing themselves in the poem. They feel everything and give the mortal form to the poem, emotions to the poem.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>C. Poetry is the expression of feeling and emotions. Explain.</strong></p><p>Ans; Poetry is a medium for poets to convey their feelings and emotions in a creative and artistic manner. It allows them to explore complex emotions, capture moments of beauty, and express their innermost thoughts in a way that resonates with readers.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"rewardTxt": "Read Summary",
"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Robert Burns' poem \"A Red, Red Rose\" is a romantic and lyrical expression of love and devotion. Let's delve into the poem's meaning and explore its hidden messages:</p><p><br /></p><p>\"O, my love is like a red, red rose, That’s newly sprung in June.\": The poem begins with a simile, comparing the speaker's love to a freshly bloomed red rose in June. It compares the speaker's love to a beautiful red rose, symbolizing love's freshness and beauty.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"O, my love is like the melody, That’s sweetly play’d in tune.\": In the second stanza, the speaker likens their love to a sweetly played melody in perfect harmony. This simile means that, just like a nice song, their love is pleasant and in perfect harmony.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"As fair art thou, my bonny lass, So deep in love am I,\": The speaker assures their beloved that she is as fair and lovely as the rose, and the speaker's love for her is strong and deep.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"And I will love thee still, my dear, Till a’ the seas gang dry.\": The speaker expresses an unwavering commitment to love their dear one until the seas run dry. This is a way of saying their love will last forever, no matter what happens.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear, And the rocks melt wi’ the sun!\": The repetition of the idea of the seas running dry and rocks melting with the sun further emphasizes the enduring and unchanging nature of the speaker's love for the beloved person.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"And I will love thee still, my dear, While the sands o’ life shall run.\": The speaker pledges to love their dear one as long as they live, using the metaphor of the sands of life running to convey the idea of the passage of time.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"And fare thee weel, my only love, And fare thee weel a while!\": The poem takes a bittersweet turn as the speaker bids farewell to their only loving person for a while. This farewell suggests a temporary parting or separation.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"And I will come again, my love, Tho’ it were ten thousand mile!\": The poem concludes with a promise of reunion. Sadly, the poem says they must say goodbye for now. But the speaker promises to return, even if it's a very long journey of \"ten thousand miles\".</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Title Significance&nbsp;</b></p><p>Robert Burns used the word \"red\" twice when comparing love to a rose in the poem. He said \"red, red\" instead of just \"red\". Repeating words is a way for poets to add emotion. Saying \"red, red\" shows that the speaker's love burns very intensely. It feels even stronger and deeper than regular love.</p><p><br /></p><p>The doubled \"red\" emphasizes how passionate and long-lasting the love is. It helps convey the message that the speaker will love their beloved forever.</p><p><br /></p><p>In short, the poem shows that true love can endure forever through good and bad times. It beautifully captures the deep emotions of loving someone special, even from far away. The language and comparisons make the message of eternal love more powerful.</p><p><br /></p>"

    "story": "<p><strong>All the world’s a stage</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Written by The SR Zone | Shriram Lamichhane</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Exercise</strong></p><p>Understanding the text</p><p><strong>a. Why does the poet compare the world with a stage?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The poet compares the world to a stage because he likens all people as players in a play. These players take on various roles on this stage (world) and eventually depart (die).</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. What is the first stage in a human’s life? In what sense can it be a troubling stage?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The first stage in a human's life is infancy, where the infant is described as \"Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.\" It can be a troubling stage because infants are entirely dependent on others for their care and cannot communicate their needs effectively.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Describe the second stage of life based on the poem.</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The second stage of life, as described in the poem, is that of the schoolboy. In this stage, the schoolboy is characterized as having a \"shining morning face\" but going to school \"creeping like snail\" and \"unwillingly.\" This stage represents the reluctance and resistance that some children may have towards education.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Why is the last stage called second childhood?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The last stage is called \"second childishness\" because it mirrors the helplessness and dependency of infancy, but in old age. It is a stage of decline in physical and mental faculties, so it is called a second childhood.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. In what sense are we the players on the world stage?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;We are the players on the global stage, as we enter it when we are born, play different roles on stage like we live different lives along our lifespan and exit it when we die, much like players/performers on a stage.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference to the text</p><p><strong>a. Explain the following lines:</strong></p><p>In the provided words, the poet claims that life is similar to a theatre. Everyone is considered an actor who performs different roles in real life. Each actor enters the stage and performs his or her part in the play and exits at a time. Each person takes on various roles in the same way and leaves the stage that the actors on stage do.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Explain briefly the following sentences about the context.</strong></p><p>These lines are similar to the roles performed on stage by actors and individuals in their daily lives. We all have various roles to perform, much like the characters in a play. A person's life is divided into seven stages, each with its own set of traits. In a play, each actor enters the stage, does his or her role, and then exits. We depart the stage of our life after we complete our roles. Similarly, we enter the world stage when we are born and exit it when we die.</p><p><br /></p><p>Throughout his life, a man is bound to perform a variety of roles. The poet wants us to realise that life is like a stage for a play.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Read the given lines and answer the questions that follow.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>i. Which stage of life is being referred to here by the poet?</strong></p><p>The poet is referring to the period of life known as childhood.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ii. Which figure of speech has been employed in the second line?</strong></p><p>In the second line, simile, a figure of speech in which the kid is likened to a snail using like, is used.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iii. Who is compared to the snail?</strong></p><p>The snail is used to compare the schoolboy.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iv. Does the boy go to the school willingly?</strong></p><p>No, the kid does not want to go to school. His hesitation could simply be compared to a snail moving towards his school.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Simile and metaphor are the two major poetic devices used in this poem. Explain citing examples of each.</strong></p><p>A simile uses the terms \"like\" or \"as\" in place of comparisons. Direct analogies are used instead of using like or as in metaphors. Shakespeare has used such literary methods in this poem as well.</p><p><br /></p><p>'All the world’s a stage,' and 'all the men and women merely players,' are metaphors used by Shakespeare because direct comparisons have been used in this context. Examples of similes in this poem are \"Creeping like a snail\" and \"soldier... bearded like the pard\" etc because of the usage of words ‘like’ and ‘as’.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. Which style does the poet use to express his emotions about how he thinks that the world is a stage and all the people living in it are mere players?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;The poet, William Shakespeare, uses a narrative style to express his perspective on the world and the people in it as actors on a stage. He presents this view in a structured and sequential manner, describing the seven stages of human life like a story unfolding.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>F. What is the main theme of this poem?</strong></p><p>Life and its seven phases are the central themes of this poem. Everyone is destined to play seven different roles throughout their lives. It conveys the idea that, in the end, we are powerless, just as we were before. Birth and death are other major themes as they symbolize the entrance and exit of the player, respectively. The poem depicts how a person begins their life as a child and ends it as a stage when he returns to being a child.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference beyond the text</p><p><strong>a. Describe the various stages of human life picturised in the poem \"All the world's a stage.\"</strong></p><p>Shakespeare compares life to a play with different parts. The first part is as a baby - helpless and needing care. Then a child goes to school. After that comes being a young lover filled with passion. Next is a energetic soldier devoted to duty. The fifth part is a wise and mature judge. Then comes retirement when eyes droop and voice shakes. In the end, all senses, memories, and strength fade until death. These are the seven stages from birth to death that Shakespeare writes about.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Is Shakespeare's comparison of human's life with a drama stage apt?</strong>&nbsp;How?</p><p>Shakespeare's comparison of life to a play is fitting. He sees the world as a theater with people taking on different roles. In a play, each actor comes on stage, performs their part, and leaves. Our lives are similar - we are all born, live out our personalities, and die. Just as actors do their roles and parts, Shakespeare said people go through seven life stages - baby, child, lover, soldier, judge, old person, very old person. On the stage of life, we each get a turn to act out those roles before exiting permanently through death, just as in a play. So Shakespeare's view of life imitating a theatrical performance makes sense.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"rewardTxt": "Read Summary",
"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>William Shakespeare's poem \"All the world's a stage\" is from his play \"As You Like It.\" It presents a metaphorical perspective on the stages of human life and the roles people play. Let's break down the poem's meaning and hidden messages:</p><p><br /></p><p>\"All the world's a stage,\": This line establishes the central metaphor of the poem. Shakespeare compares the entire world to a stage, suggesting that life is like a theatrical performance, and people are the actors.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"And all the men and women merely players,\": Shakespeare emphasizes that every person in the world is an actor in this grand play of life. We all have our roles to play, and these roles define our experiences.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"They have their exits and their entrances,\": This line acknowledges that people come and go in life. Birth and death are the entrances and exits from the stage of existence. It reflects the cyclical nature of life.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"And one man in his time plays many parts,\": Each individual goes through various stages or phases in life, playing different roles at different times. This suggests the idea of personal growth and development.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"His acts being seven ages.\": Shakespeare divides a person's life into seven stages, each with its characteristics and challenges. These stages represent the journey from infancy to old age.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"At first, the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.\": The first stage is infancy, where a baby is helpless and dependent, represented by the image of crying and vomiting in the nurse's arms.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school.\": The second stage is childhood, where a child reluctantly goes to school, carrying books (satchel) and having a bright, innocent face.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"And then the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress' eyebrow.\": The third stage is adolescence and young adulthood, characterized by the passion and romance of love. The lover is infatuated and composes love poems.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"Then a soldier, Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon's mouth.\": The fourth stage represents the warrior or ambitious stage of life. The soldier is brave but also quick to anger and eager for recognition.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part.\": The fifth stage signifies maturity and responsibility. The justice is a symbol of wisdom, authority, and experience.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on side; His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his sound.\": The sixth stage represents old age and retirement. The individual becomes feeble, wears spectacles, and has a thin, stooped figure. Their voice loses its strength, resembling a child's voice.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and mere oblivion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.\": The seventh stage symbolizes extreme old age and the end of life. It is characterized by dependence and the loss of physical and mental abilities. \"Sans\" means without, emphasizing the complete loss of faculties.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Hidden Meanings and Messages:</b></p><p>Cyclical Nature of Life: The poem highlights the cyclical nature of human existence, where each stage leads to the next, ultimately returning to a state of helplessness and oblivion.</p><p><br /></p><p>Universal Experience: Shakespeare's portrayal of these life stages resonates with readers because it captures the universal experiences of birth, growth, love, ambition, wisdom, aging, and death.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reflection on Human Choices: The poem indirectly suggests that the roles people play in life are partly determined by their choices and partly by the natural progression of age. It encourages readers to reflect on their own life choices and the roles they inhabit.</p><p><br /></p><p>Timelessness: Despite being written in the 16th century, the poem's themes remain relevant today. It reminds us that the stages of life are enduring and shared by all humanity.</p><p><br /></p><p>Overall, the phrase \"All the world's a stage\" means that life is like a play with different roles we take on from birth to death. It's a thoughtful look at the stages of human existence - from baby to child, to young lover, to mature adult, to elderly person. It reminds us that we're all just acting out parts in the play of life. And it makes us think about the roles we take and how everything changes as time passes. Nothing lasts forever.</p><p><br /></p><p>The poem encourages us to reflect on our place in the world and how we're all just temporary actors on the great stage of life. It also reminds us that we'll all face old age and death eventually, just like characters who finish their roles in a play.</p><p><br /></p>"

How does Cumming's use of lower case letters affect your understanding of the poem?</strong>&nbsp;Explain.</p><p>Cummings's use of lowercase letters affects the understanding of the poem by emphasizing the humility and vulnerability of the child (\"little i\").

Describe the time and place as well as the feelings and thoughts about it.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>I was born and raised in a town. But luckily, we went to our old village home at Dashain time. It was my first time stepping on a village. It was a complete contrast to the frenetic pace of the big city. It was my first encounter with a milking cow, and I was quite taken aback. I used to think all food came from supermarkets or dairies if it wasn't organic. My grandfather took me to our paddy field the following morning. The sheer amount of vegetation astounded me. It was a welcome change from the concrete jungle I'm used to.</p><p><br /></p><p>There, I discovered how to establish a connection with the natural world. I loved watching the sun rise and set behind the towering skyscrapers of my city. We spent about a month there.

"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>This short poem by e.e. cummings is about a moment of wonder. It asks questions to help us understand its meaning.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"who are you, little i\": The poem starts with the person talking to a small child. We know it's a child because the word \"i\" is written in small letters. The author often used small and capital letters in special ways to share his ideas. The small \"i\" shows that the child is young and little.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"peering from some high window\": The child is described as looking out from a high window. This image can be interpreted as the child observing the world from a position of curiosity and perhaps a bit of isolation. The \"high window\" may also symbolize a vantage point, a perspective from which the child sees things differently.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"at the gold of November sunset\": The child is gazing at the golden hues of a November sunset. This description captures a feeling of beauty and wonder. November is typically associated with the transition from autumn to winter, and the golden sunset may symbolize the fleeting nature of beauty and warmth.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"(and feeling: that if day has to become night\": Here, the child is not only observing the sunset but also feeling something profound. The child recognizes and accepts that the daily shift from daytime to nighttime happens naturally is something that cannot be stopped or controlled.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"this is a beautiful way)\": The child perceives the sunset as a beautiful way for the day to turn into night. This line highlights the child's innocence and ability to find beauty in simplicity.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>In summary, the poem talks about a child watching the sunset from a high window in November. The child sees the beauty in the changing colors of the sky from day to night. This shows that children can find beauty where adults might not.</p><p><br /></p><p>It celebrates how children see the world with innocence and wonder. The child enjoying the simple moment of the sunset reflects a pure appreciation for life. The way the poet arranges the words on the page makes the poem special too. It encourages readers to look at it with the same sense of wonder as a child.</p><p><br /></p><p>The hidden message may be that we should appreciate everyday beauty. We should also try to see the world with fresh, unbiased eyes like children do.</p><p><br /></p>"

Who is the speaker addressing and why can that person not hear or understand what she is saying?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The speaker is actually addressing her husband who died on a war. He cannot hear or understand what she is saying because he is dead.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. What can you infer about the speaker’s feelings for the person addressed as “you”?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The speaker's feelings for the person addressed as \"you\" are characterized by deep love and grief. The poem suggests that they were once in love, and the speaker's mourning and longing for the lost loved one are evident throughout the poem.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What is the speaker’s attitude toward war?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The speaker has a negative outlook on war. During the Vietnam War, she lost her husband, whom she loved more than anything in the world. He hasn't been there for her, and it's made her miserable.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. In what ways do you think this person’s fate has affected the speaker?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The person's fate has affected the speaker profoundly, causing her to experience the loss of love, youth, and happiness. The Speaker has lost her husband in war whom she loves the most. While serving in the American-Vietnamese battle, he was killed by a bomb. Widowhood has left the speaker feeling isolated all alone in the world. She is not able to recover the pain of losing her most loved person.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. What does the speaker promise at the end of the poem? Why do you think the speaker does this?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;The speaker promises to meet her husband in another life. She wants to keep the shrapnel (metal pieces) as a way to identify each other. This shows how much she deeply cares for the person she calls \"you\". It means her love and missing them will continue forever. This gives hope that their connection will go on beyond this physical world.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference to the text</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>a. What is the theme of the poem?</strong></p><p>The theme of the poem revolves around love, loss, and the devastating impact of war on personal lives.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. What imagery from the poem made the greatest impression on you?</strong>&nbsp;Why?</p><p>The poem uses strong imageries to show the difference between what the speaker gives her love compared to what she gets back. She offers romantic things like roses, her wedding dress, and her youthfulness. But in return, she gets military items like his husband's honors, the smell of blood and his dead body. This big difference effectively shows how war has changed her emotionally and physically. The poem uses this contrast to deeply express how war can harm relationships and in personal level of people. It powerfully comments on war's tragic impacts.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Which figurative language is used in the poem? Explain with examples.</strong></p><p>The poem uses many non-literal meanings which is also called figurative language. This poem uses irony, apostrophe, anaphora and metaphor to express deeper meanings beyond the literal words. Figurative language makes the message more powerful.</p><p><br /></p><p>Irony is when words mean the opposite of what they say. The speaker talks of \"gifts\" from war but really means the sadness it caused. Apostrophe addresses someone not there, like speaking to her dead husband. Anaphora repeats the same words, like \"I offer you\" at the start of lines. Similarly, metaphor compares two unlike things that share something, likening her sorrow to summer clouds. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. What does the speaker “offer” in this poem? What does the person addressed as “you” give in return?</strong></p><p>The speaker offers her feelings, love, youth, memories and things that remind her of their love to the person she calls \"you\". But all she get back are military medals, stars and the smell of blood from the war. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. An apostrophe is a literary device in which a writer or speaker addresses an absent person or an abstract idea in such a way as if it were present and can be understood. Discuss the poem in relation to the apostrophe.</strong></p><p>The speaker uses an apostrophe to mention her late husband. By doing so, she has been able to communicate her emotions and her sorrow to him in a straightforward manner. This helps her in lowering her pain and sorrow. She was also able to deliver the message and make the commitment to meet again in the future by addressing the missing \"you.\"</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference beyond the text</p><p><strong>a. One way to get relief from grief is to write or talk about it. In your opinion, how might the speaker in this poem have benefitted from saying what she did?&nbsp;Explain.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>When we share our sorrow, our pain reduces a bit because we can get sympathy by sharing our pain. The speaker was able to lessen the pain of her wartime experience for her listeners and viewers by emphasizing the actions and efforts she made in her solitary life. When a person gets wounded in war, it affects everyone around them, not just the one who is injured. One of the most helpful things the speaker did was write a poem in memory of her late husband. She is more at ease now that she thinks she has talked with him face to face. Assurance that they will reunite in the hereafter warms her heart. The speaker has used a wide range of literary strategies to make her feelings of grief, sadness, and love for the deceased, as well as her anger and horror at war, clear to the audience.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Write an essay on the effects of war.</strong></p><p>War is a really bad thing that hurts a lot of people and places. War affects individuals, communities, and whole countries. The bad effects of war last a long time.</p><p><br /></p><p>First, war causes physical harm. It hurts and kills many soldiers and civilians. It destroys homes, neighborhoods, and cities. Families break apart and people are left with scars and disabilities. The damage to things like hospitals, schools, and services makes the suffering worse.</p><p><br /></p><p>Second, the psychological impact of war can't be understated. Soldiers experience trauma which can lead to things like PTSD. Civilians who are caught in the middle feel immense stress and fear for their lives. The mental scars of war can stick around even after the fighting is over, affecting people's mental health and well-being.</p><p><br /></p><p>Also, war disrupts societies and tears communities apart. Forced moves, refugee crises, and breakdowns in social structure leave deep wounds. Families are separated, and the bonds that hold groups of people together are strained. The loss of trust and problems with social cohesion can slow recovery for a long time after peace.</p><p><br /></p><p>Economically, war takes resources away from important sectors like education, healthcare, and infrastructure. The cost of conflict uses funds that could otherwise help human development. Economies after war often struggle to get better, making life harder for countries and increasing poverty.</p><p><br /></p><p>In conclusion, war has deep and terrible effects. It causes injuries, trauma, turmoil in societies, and financial difficulties. The scars of war stick around even after the fighting stops, reminding us of humanity's ability to both destroy and rebuild. Efforts to prevent and lessen the impacts of war remain crucial for a more peaceful and caring world.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>This poem is very sad and emotional. It talks about how war affects people and their relationships. It talks about love, sacrifice, loss and keeping a connection with someone even after they die. Let's break down the poem and understand what it really means:</p><p><br /></p><p>The poem starts with the person giving roses and a wedding dress to someone who died in the war. This shows how much they loved that person and wanted to remember them. The wedding dress represents dreams that will never happen now and a life cut short.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the next part, the dead person gives back medals, stars and small metal pieces to the speaker. These were given to them for fighting bravely in the war. But they were \"unused and still shining\", meaning the dead person never got to enjoy their achievements because of dying young.</p><p><br /></p><p>The speaker offers their youth, meaning they lost their happy and carefree time because of her favourite and beloved person's death. Her days of love have turned to sorrow.</p><p><br /></p><p>The war uniform the dead person wore still smells of blood, from them and the enemy. This reminds us how brutal and violent war really is and how it still affects the speaker.</p><p><br /></p><p>The speaker offers clouds and cold winters now, instead of the spring seasons of life. This shows how the war has made her life feel sad and gloomy.</p><p><br /></p><p>Even after giving all these things, the dead person can't give anything back. Their lips don't smile, arms don't hug and eyes can't see. It's like the war took their soul.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the end, the speaker apologizes for not being able to prevent the death of the person and promises to meet them again after death. She says shrapnel (metal pieces) from the war will recognize each other then. This shows their eternal love and hope to reunite beyond death. The poem teaches us how wars destroy lives and relationships.</p><p><br /></p>"

    "title": "1. Sharing Tradition",
    "story": "<p><strong>Sharing Tradition</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Written by The SR Zone | Shriram Lamichhane</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Exercise</strong></p><p>Understanding the texts</p><p>Answer the following questions.</p><p><strong>a. According to LaPena, what is the importance of the oral tradition? To what extent do you agree with his opinions and why?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans :According to LaPena, the oral tradition is really important for keeping our culture's values and traditions alive. He says that it's important for each person to pass on what they have learned in life so the next generation becomes more practical and aware. I agree with him because oral tradition is key in preserving our cultural heritage and sharing knowledge from one generation to the next. It's a lively and dynamic way of communicating that can tell us not just facts, but also the heart and soul of our culture's identity and values.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Who preserves and passes on the oral tradition?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans : The main responsibility for preserving and passing on the oral tradition lies with the elders. They possess the wisdom and firsthand experiences of their culture, making them the natural carriers of this knowledge to the younger generations, and the young generation becomes responsbile for preserving the culture next.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What is the danger of not passing on information from generation to generation?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans : If information isn't passed down from one generation to the next, our tradition's culture and values can die. Without the culture and traditional values, people will be out of the moral and spiritual boundaries. When knowledge is not transmitted, it can create a gap and disconnect from one's cultural heritage, which can lead to the erosion of the culture itself and a loss of the feeling of belonging.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. What is the difference between oral tradition and literary tradition?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans : Oral tradition and literary tradition are two different ways of sharing information from the past. The main difference is how they are passed down. Oral tradition uses speaking to share stories, histories, and knowledge from parents to children and between generations. Literary tradition uses writing instead. Information is recorded in books, texts, or other written forms so it can be read by others. Writing or literary tradtion preserves the exact information for the future but oral tradtion does not.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. How does LaPena establish a relationship between art and the oral tradition?</strong></p><p>Ans : LaPena establishes a relationship between art and the oral tradition by discussing how the oral tradition influences artists in visualizing stories, characters, designs, and colors for their artwork. This art can be used to transfer oral traditions to newer genrations more effectively.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference the context</p><p><strong>a. LaPena states that the oral tradition helps maintain the values of a culture. If you believe that the oral tradition is important, how would you maintain it?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans : I'll do all I can to spread knowledge about culture and values among my friends and acquaintances. I will tell everyone about the benefits that people get from keeping oral traditions. I will make an effort to raise awareness about the value of oral tradition. I will spread the message that we should pay greater attention to what our elders have to say. I will possibly conduct interviews with older people as well. For public use, I will engage in making audio copies, videos, animations of narrations, folktales, epics, and so on to convery words to newer generation.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. “Not everyone is capable of fulfilling the roles of the elders.” Explain this statement with reference to the essay.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans : LaPena's statement, \"Not everyone is capable of fulfilling the roles of the elders,\" implies that becoming an elder is not solely determined by age but also by the contributions and knowledge that certain people acquire over their lives. While everyone may grow older, not everyone develops the specialized understanding, skills, and depth of cultural knowledge that some elders possess. These exceptional elders have a distinct role in their community, and when they pass away, it becomes challenging to fill the void they leave behind.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What is the controlling idea or thesis of this essay?</strong></p><p>Ans : The controlling idea or thesis of this essay is the significance of the oral tradition in preserving cultural values and knowledge, the challenges of passing it on, and the importance of individual responsibility in this process.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. How do topic sentences guide the reader through the essay? What would be lost without them?</strong></p><p>Ans : Topic sentences are important in essays. They tell the reader what each paragraph will be about. This helps the reader follow the essay's structure and main ideas. Without topic sentences, the essay would not be organized clearly. The reader would have a hard time understanding the author's points and argument. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. What are the four major problems developed by LaPena with regard to maintaining the oral tradition. How are they used to structure the essay?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans : The four major problems developed by LaPena regarding maintaining the oral tradition are:</p><p><br /></p><p>The Difficulty of Passing Knowledge: This problem highlights the challenge of transmitting cultural knowledge from elders to younger generations effectively.</p><p><br /></p><p>Generational Gap: LaPena discusses the gap in generations due to changing technologies, which can lead to a loss of cultural continuity.</p><p><br /></p><p>Issues with Modern Education: He addresses how modern education systems does not prioritize oral traditions and may lead to a disconnect from cultural values.</p><p><br /></p><p>Accuracy and Misrepresentation: LaPena raises concerns about the potential errors and misrepresentations when translating oral tradition into written records or when outsiders collect information without proper understanding.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Reference beyond the text</strong></p><p><strong>a. Write a paragraph or two explaining your attitude toward the oral tradition of passing along information.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans: I really value the oral tradition of sharing information in cultures. To me, oral tradition is the life of a community's identity and history. It's how wisdom, values, and stories are passed from parents to children. This tradition keeps our cultural heritage alive. It lets us learn not just facts but also feelings, details, and meaning that make our culture special. Oral tradition connects us to past generations and helps us understand the full story of what we have in common.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Our culture is our identity. Write a few paragraphs explaining how you intend to preserve your culture, values and norms.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Ans : Keeping our culture alive is very important. I will take an active role to preserve our cultures and tradtions. First, listening to elders is key. Hearing their experiences helps me understand our cultural identity deeply.

"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>The essay talks about keeping traditions alive by means of oral tradition ( by talking, speaking via mouth or words). It is difficult to preserve traditions after important people who carried them, like elders, have passed away. Elders used stories and sharing knowledge to teach cultural values. When elders are gone, others must learn and share what the elders knew to keep traditions alive.</p><p><br /></p><p>Not everyone can do what elders did. The essay talks about special roles some elders had in the community. These roles involved the preserving of religion and culture. Now many people must work together to fill these roles. The essay also talks about differences between generations. Technology and more people deviating away from culture make it hard to follow traditions linked to nature.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>It is important that information and knowledge of culture gets shared through oral method. But now, school and degrees are given more importance than community traditions. When cultures are transmitted via oral method or stories, people may misunderstand or change details by mistake. He says correcting mistakes in oral transmission is easier than correcting mistakes in printed books which is indeed difficult.</p><p><br /></p><p>The essay says we think books by experts always have the right answers. But no one knows everything. It's okay to admit we don't know and ask others. The author states it's okay to admit when you don't know something and can ask elders for help.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Oral traditions are more flexible than written traditions. Stories told orally can change over time based on feedback from listeners. But modern stories may be hard to verify since we can't always confirm who the original source was. The essay says we need patience and exposure over time to really understand information.</p><p><br /></p><p>It also talks about how oral traditions influence art - how artists visualize stories, characters, designs, colors and atmospheres. But artists have choices in how closely they follow tradition or take more creative liberties. Each artist approaches their work differently and brings their own perspective.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the conclusion, the author says as an artist themselves they won't say exactly how traditions should impact art. Instead, that is shown through individual artists' works and interpretations. It encourages respecting tradition while also following personal inspiration. Most importantly, the essay stresses the responsibility of younger generations to honor elders and traditions by preserving and sharing them.</p><p><br /></p>"

    "title": "2. How to live before you die?",
    "story": "<p><strong>How to live before you die?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Written by The SR Zone | Shriram Lamichhane</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Understanding the text</strong></p><p>Answer the following questions.</p><p><strong>a. What is the story about Steve Jobs’ birth?</strong></p><p>Steve Jobs was put up for adoption at birth by his biological mother. She was an unmarried college student at the time. He was initially meant to be adopted by a lawyer and his wife. However, they changed their minds at the last minute and wanted to adopt a girl instead. Steve was then adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, who had been waiting to adopt a child. So they ended up adopting Steve.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. What does he mean when he says, “you can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards”?</strong></p><p>When Jobs says \"you can't connect the dots looking forward,\" he means that in life, you often don't understand the importance of events or choices as they happen. It's only by looking back that you can see how everything connected to lead you to where you are now. He's emphasizing the importance of hindsight and trusting that things will make sense in the long run.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What happened when Steve Jobs turned 30?</strong></p><p>When Steve Jobs turned 30, he got fired from Apple, the company he co-founded. He was forced to leave the company he had dedicated much of his adult life to, and this was a significant turning point in his life.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>D. Jobs contends that you need to love to do what you do in order to be great at it. Do you agree or disagree?</strong>&nbsp;Why?</p><p>I agree with Jobs' statement that you need to love what you do to be great at it. When you're passionate about your work, it becomes more than just a job; it becomes a hobby or interest. This passion and dedication are often the driving forces behind achieving greatness because you're willing to invest the time and effort required to excel in your field.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. Is death really life's greatest invention?</strong></p><p>When Steve Jobs refers to death as life's greatest invention, he means that the awareness of our mortality can serve as a powerful motivator. It reminds us that life is limited and encourages us to make the most of our time, pursue our passions, and not be afraid to take risks.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Reference to the text</strong></p><p>A. Read the extract given below and answer the questions that follow:</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>i. Who was the kid?</strong></p><p>Baby Steve Jobs was the kid.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ii. What does it imply, \"do you want it?</strong>\"</p><p>The biological mother of Steve Jobs urged his parents to take him on the waiting list.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iii. Who's referring to 'they'?</strong></p><p>'They' refers to the parents of Steve Jobs on the waiting list.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Explain the following lines:</strong></p><p>i. “You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.”</p><p>Steve Jobs used this phrase to encourage everyone to put their faith and confidence in these critical elements to achieve success and greatness.</p><p><br /></p><p>ii. “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.”</p><p>His message on this line is that time moves so fast. Time does not stand still. We need to make the most of the time we have left if we want to see into the future. It's his belief that we should make the most of the time we have, rather than wasting it by living someone else's.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What does he mean by “don’t settle”?</strong></p><p>It means don't accept something that is just okay or average if you can do better. Don't compromise and settle for less than what you really want or deserve. Keep looking for opportunities that you are truly excited about and passionate about, even if you have to keep searching for a while.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Which style of speech is used by the speaker to persuade the audience?</strong></p><p>Steve Jobs uses real-life experiences, emotional language and motivational themes to create an inspiring and energizing speech experience for his audience.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>E. It is not easy to motivate others. How do you think Steve Jobs’ speech is so inspiring?</strong></p><p>Steve Jobs' speech is inspiring because it mixes stories about his personal life with lessons for everyone. By telling about his own real life struggles and success, he makes his message easy to relate to. This shows that even very successful people face problems and don't always win. It helps the audience connect with him. He also shares encouraging words about following your dreams and being true to yourself. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. Why do you think Steve Jobs used the personal narrative story telling technique in his speech? What influence does it have on the audiences?</strong></p><p>Steve Jobs uses personal narrative storytelling in his speech to make his message more relatable and engaging. By sharing his own life experiences, he connects with the audience on a personal level. This technique helps to establish trust and authenticity, making his words more impactful. It also helps people see how they can use what he teaches in their own lives. When people hear about real examples instead of just ideas, they are more likely to remember what he said and think about how it could apply to them too.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference beyond the text</p><p><strong>a. One of Steve Jobs mottos was: 'Think differently'. Can this make a person succeed in life? What challenges are there in thinking differently?</strong></p><p>Yes, if you change the way you think, it can help you succeed in life. When you think differently, you come up with new ideas and find opportunities. However, there are difficulties in thinking differently. People often don't like new or unusual ideas, so it can be hard to use creative thinking in existing systems or industries. Thinking differently means taking risks and entering new areas, which can be uncertain. People who think differently may face doubt or criticism from others who don't understand their unique perspectives. It's challenging to keep going when you encounter obstacles while pursuing different ideas. To overcome these challenges, you need to be determined, strong, and willing to adapt to the change.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b.What does the slogan “Stay hungry; stay foolish” mean to you?</strong></p><p>The slogan means to always keep learning new things and to not be afraid to try new experiences, even if you might fail.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"Stay hungry\" means to always want to learn more and never stop learning new skills or getting new knowledge. It means to always feel curious and ambitious to improve yourself.</p><p><br /></p><p>\"Stay foolish\" means to not be afraid of taking chances or risks, even if other people think it's silly. It's okay to make mistakes as long as you learn from them. Staying \"foolish\" means keeping an open mind and being willing to try new things that you may not know much about.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>C. What does it mean to be a visionary?&nbsp;What makes Steve Jobs different from a fortune teller?</strong></p><p>A visionary is someone who can imagine new ideas and innovations that don't exist yet. They can see opportunities for change and ways to do things better. Visionaries like Steve Jobs challenged the normal way of doing things. Visionaries don't just predict what will happen - they make their visions into reality through hard work and new inventions and products. Steve Jobs envisioned new computers and phones and then created them at Apple.</p><p><br /></p><p>On the other hand, fortune tellers say that they can see what will happen in the future, but they don't actually make the future happen. They just claim to predict events, maybe using mystical powers. Visionaries are active creators who drive change through their innovative ideas. Fortune tellers are more passive because they only foresee the future instead of shaping it with new technologies or businesses like visionaries do. Visionaries are doers who make their visions into fact, unlike fortune tellers who just predict outcomes.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Steve Jobs gave a speech at Stanford University in 2005. He told three stories from his life.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the first story, he talked about \"connecting the dots\". He dropped out of college after 6 months as he didn't know what to study. Later many things happened that led him to start Apple. Though he didn't understand it then, dropping out helped him in future. He said we should trust that things will make sense later even if they don't now.</p><p><br /></p><p>The second story was about \"love and loss.\" He co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak in his parents' garage. The company grew rapidly. But later, his ideas differed from the company and he was fired. This failure made him think about his passions. It also led to new companies like NeXT and Pixar. Getting fired freed him to try new creative things and return to help Apple succeed again.</p><p><br /></p><p>The third story was about \"death.\" He was diagnosed with a cancer thought to be untreatable. Facing possible death changed how he saw life. He learned to live each day like the last. He urged students to follow their passions.&nbsp;He realized the importance of living each day fully and doing what you love.</p><p><br /></p><p>Through the stories from his life, Jobs shared lessons about being resilient, following one's interests, and accepting uncertainty. He wanted the graduates to keep learning and trusting their intuitions.</p><p><br /></p>"

    "story": "<p><strong>What I require from life</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Written by The SR Zone | Shriram Lamichhane</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Understanding the text</strong></p><p>Answer the following questions.</p><p><strong>a. How does the writer distinguish between a peaceful age and a heroic age?</strong></p><p>The writer talks about two different times he has lived through - peaceful age (a time of peace) and heroic age (a time of heroes.)</p><p>When he was younger, he lived during a time of peace. Everything was calm and he thought his whole life would be that way - without any big problems. But then 1914 came when World War 1 started. Since then, he has been living in a different time, a time of heroes. It has been a time of lots of trouble, fights, wars, conflicts and risks. That's why the writer sees the time before 1914 as peaceful, but now as the time of heroes - because it takes bravery to live through such war and fight times.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Why does the writer want more freedom of speech than most people?</strong></p><p>The writer wants more freedom of speech than most people because he wants to openly express his opinions and criticisms about various products that are harmful or poisonous. He is frustrated by laws that prevent him from speaking his mind freely. He seeks the freedom to expose what the harmful products.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. According to the writer, what are the four general human needs?</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the writer, the four general human needs are:</p><p>Work and a decent wage for one's labor.</p><p>Health, including access to medical care and well-being.</p><p>Friendship, particularly with colleagues in scientific and political work.</p><p>Freedom, with a desire for more freedom of speech.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. What is the difference between desire and demand according to the writer?</strong></p><p>→ The writer views some things as requirements for living, while considering other things as nice to have but not absolutely necessary. His demands are food, warmth, work, freedom, health and social interaction. Other comforts are not as important like having a car, having a lot of wealth, banglows and mansions which are just desires.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. Why does the writer demand security?</strong>?</p><p>→&nbsp;The writer demands security because he sees a lot of danger and threats in the world, especially because of fascism and the possibility of wars. He believes that people should be safe and not constantly worried about their safety. So, he wants to make sure that others are secure and protected from harm.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference to the text</p><p><strong>Explain the following lines with reference to the text:</strong></p><p>a. “The satisfaction of adventure is something much more solid than a thrill.”</p><p><br /></p><p>The writer says that adventure feels much better than just getting a quick thrill. Adventure is more meaningful and fulfilling, while thrills are like simple, shallow excitement.</p><p><br /></p><p>b. “I want the workers to see the fruit of their own work not in profits for others, but in their own and their friends’ well-being.”</p><p><br /></p><p>b. The writer wants workers to benefit directly from their hard work, instead of their work only making rich people richer. He wants work to make everyone's life better, including the workers and their co-workers or friends.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Why do you think the essayist has taken reference from the ancient philosophers?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>The essayist has taken reference from the ancient philosophers in order to make his words and ideologies more strong and credible in front of the readers. The old thinkers thought about things like work, freedom and socialism too. By talking about them, the writer shows that people have had the same wants and needs for a very long time. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Discuss the essay in terms of its language, purpose, subject, point of view and mode of writing.</strong></p><p>This essay is meant to both reflect the writer's own thoughts and persuade the reader. The language is easy to understand so many people can read it. The main goals are to share what is important to the writer and support socialist ideas that make society fair for all. It talks about things like what people need, how society should help each other, socialism, and problems at that time like fascism and war.</p><p><br /></p><p>The writer tells the story from his own point of view, using \"I\" and sharing his experiences. The essay both describes things and makes an argument. It describes what the writer wants and needs. It also argues that socialism is a good idea by giving reasons why people should support it. Overall, the essay aims to both reflect on personal views and persuade readers of certain political views.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference beyond the text</p><p><strong>a. What do you require from your life to be happy and satisfied?</strong></p><p>For me to be content and happy, I need to be healthy, have prestige in society, good familial relationships and have a job with a reasonable salary.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. What is socialism? How is it different from capitalism?</strong></p><p>Socialism is an economic and political system where the government or society as a whole owns and controls things like businesses, factories, and resources. In socialism, the goal is to make sure wealth and resources are shared more equally among people.</p><p><br /></p><p>Capitalism, on the other hand, is a system where individuals and private companies own and control businesses and resources. In capitalism, the focus is on individual profit and competition in the marketplace. This means some people may have a lot of wealth, while others may have less.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Write an essay about your dream house.</strong></p><p><strong>My dream house</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>If I could choose any house, it would be a cozy, big cabin in the woods. I really love nature and feel happiest when I'm in a forest. My dream house would be surrounded by trees on a few acres of land, so it's both private and beautiful.</p><p><br /></p><p>The outside of the house would match the natural colors of the forest, with brown, green, and grey tones. It would have large windows everywhere so I can see the pretty forest views. Even though it looks rustic on the outside, the inside would be modern and bright. The rooms would flow into each other with an open layout, but still have separate spaces for cooking, eating, and relaxing.</p><p><br /></p><p>The kitchen would be the most important part of the house for me. I love cooking, and I'd be so happy cooking while looking out at the green trees through the windows. There would be a big living area next to the kitchen with a comfy sofa and a TV on the wall. The living room would open up to a big wooden deck, perfect for eating outside or reading a book.</p><p><br /></p><p>Upstairs, there would be a big loft that's like my bedroom retreat. There would be a huge bed and big windows, so I can wake up and see the forest. The bathroom connected to the bedroom would have a big bathtub and a glass-walled shower. There would also be other bedrooms and an office for guests or working without any distractions.</p><p><br /></p><p>The land around my dream cabin would be peaceful and great for fun activities. I imagine going for runs on forest trails in the morning or having bonfires under the stars at night. Overall, a cabin in the woods is where I feel the most relaxed and inspired. It would be the perfect place to escape from the busy city life.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>This essay begins with the author saying we must accept life as it is, not expect impossible things. The author talks about their life starting in a peaceful time but living through many problems since 1914. They want to make the best of their current situation.</p><p><br /></p><p>The author lists what he need in life. This includes food, water, clothing and shelter. He thinks work should be challenging and interesting, where you can see the results of your work.

    "story": "<p><strong>What is Poverty?</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Written by The SR Zone | Shriram Lamichhane</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Understanding the text</strong></p><p>Answer the following Questions</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>a. What is poverty according to Parker?</strong></p><p>According to Parker, poverty means being filthy and stinky, reusing the underdypers for childs due to the lack of money, stale food, mental pressure, lack of sanitation, loss of prestige from society, a state of deprivation and struggle, lacking basic necessities, and facing constant challenges related to health, hygiene, and daily life.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. How is poverty difficult for Parker’s children?</strong>&nbsp;List some specific examples.</p><p>Poverty is difficult for Parker's children in several ways. Some specific examples include:</p><p>-Lack of proper clothing and shoes.</p><p>-Insufficient and unhealthy food.</p><p>-Poor living conditions with a foul smell and unclean surroundings.</p><p>-Limited access to healthcare and medications.</p><p>-Inadequate education and school supplies.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. How does Parker try to obtain help, and what problems does she encounter?</strong></p><p>She tries to obtain a loan by going to a close family member but in vain. For help, she goes to different offices, makes four or five rounds to the building. She enters the room, wanders here and there. Someone finally appears and inquires as to if she needs assistance. But she realises that she went to the incorrect office after giving him the entire story about her poverty. After that, it's back to step one. It is like a loop of trouble.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Why are people’s opinions and prejudices her greatest obstacles?</strong></p><p>People's opinions and prejudices are her greatest obstacles because they often judge her. This judgment makes it difficult for her to seek help without feeling shame and embarrassment. People who don’t even have faced the difficulties give their opinions to her which are without any doubt, very immature and impractical. Nobody helps her financially but everyone is ready to give her tons of opinions.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. How does Parker defend her inability to get help?&nbsp;How does she discount the usual solutions society has for poverty (e.g., welfare, education, and health clinics)?</strong></p><p>Parker defends her inability to get help by highlighting the lack of the support systems in place, such as welfare, education, and health clinics. She emphasizes the limitations and challenges faced by people in poverty, making it clear that these solutions are not as effective as they may seem.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Reference to the text</strong></p><p><strong>a. Explain the following: Poverty is looking into a black future.</strong></p><p>→&nbsp;\"Poverty is looking into a black future\" means that poverty creates a void and uncertain future for poor people and their families, filled with hardships and challenges.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. What does Parker mean by “The poor are always silent”?</strong></p><p>\"The poor are always silent\" suggests that people in poverty often suffer in silence and do not have the means or the voice to speak out about their struggles and hardships.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What writing strategy does the author use at the beginning of most of the paragraphs? Do you notice a recurring pattern? What is it?</strong></p><p>I've noticed a repeating trend at the beginning of almost every paragraph. Most of the time, she starts her paragraphs with repetition of phrase \"Poverty is...\" to emphasise her own sense of helplessness and desperation as a result of her financial situation. It is her goal to make people feel about the actual image of poverty, not only the one they see in the media. She succeeds in building a connection with the audience by writing in an informal, repetitious manner.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. How does Parker develop each paragraph? What details make each paragraph memorable?</strong></p><p>Parker develops each paragraph by providing vivid and detailed descriptions of the challenges and hardships faced by her and her family. These details make each paragraph memorable and emotionally impactful.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. In the final paragraph, how does the author use questions to involve the reader in the issue of poverty?</strong></p><p>In the final paragraph, the writer asks questions to make the reader think about poverty from their own point of view. These questions encourage the reader to feel empathy and take action or become aware of the difficulties faced by people in poverty.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference beyond the text</p><p><strong>a. Define a social problem (homelessness, unemployment, racism) imitating Parker’s style.</strong></p><p>Homelessness, a relentless adversary in the shadows of prosperity, is a serious problem where people have no place to live and are forced to sleep on the cold streets. It reminds us of society's failures even when there is plenty for everyone. It makes people feel hopeless and uncertain about their future.</p><p><br /></p><p>Unemployment, an unyielding quagmire of destitution, is another big problem where many people don't have jobs and struggle to make a living. It leads to a lot of free time and a loss of hope for a better life. It causes financial instability and affects both households and communities. Unemployment shows how society is not fair for everyone.</p><p><br /></p><p>Racism, an enduring stain on the fabric of humanity, is a long-standing issue that divides people based on their race. It causes prejudice and discrimination, hurting generations and undermining justice and equality. Racism is a big challenge that prevents unity and peaceful coexistence. It goes against the principles of fairness and kindness and needs to be addressed.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>B. Write a brief definition essay on Growing Up in Poverty using adjectives to emphasise the futility of the circumstance.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Growing Up in Poverty: An Essay</strong></p><p>Poverty is a deeply shameful problem in society that strips people of their dignity. It creates a division between those who have and those who don't. Poverty affects people in many ways, such as politically, economically, socially, psychologically, and physically. It causes conflicts within communities.</p><p><br /></p><p>Growing up in poverty is a terrible experience. It means lacking proper clothing, food, and other basic necessities. You wouldn't have regular, nutritious meals and your clothes would be stained and torn. The water you have access to might be contaminated, leading to serious health issues.</p><p><br /></p><p>Poverty is caused by factors like illegal money, corruption, poor farming practices, and a growing population. It has various consequences for the country, including death and child labor. Poverty is a problem that affects all of us.</p><p><br /></p><p>To address poverty, the government should implement programs that provide irrigation infrastructure for farmers and support the poor by offering education and housing programs. It's difficult for people like us to truly understand what it's like to live in poverty.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

The professional addressed as ‘you’ in the sentence “If you are clever, why are you so poor?</strong>” refers to a…</p><p><br /></p><p>i. lawyer ii. doctor iii. scientist iv. businessman. Justify your choice.</p><p><br /></p><p>Answer is scientist, of course. Scientists have sharp brains that make them brilliant people. Compared to other professions like attorneys, physicians, and businesspeople, their salaries are far lower in this group. The author's goal is to demonstrate that scientists may be very intelligent, but that intelligence does not always translate into financial success.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. The writer says, “I found myself in Geneva.” What does it express?</strong></p><p>The phrase \"I found myself in Geneva\" expresses surprise and unexpectedness. It indicates that the author was unexpectedly called to Geneva, which was not something he had planned or anticipated.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Are the following statements true? Why or why not?

Scientists are skilled at solving problems, and their work frequently leads to advancements in technology, medicine, and various industries. This makes their contributions highly practical and significant.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference beyond the text</p><p><strong>a. Everyone lives under the fear of annihilation by nuclear weapons. Explain this statement.</strong></p><p>The statement \"Everyone lives under the fear of annihilation by nuclear weapons\" reflects the widespread anxiety and uncertainty that existed during the Cold War and continues to some extent today. The United States and the Soviet Union, both possessing nuclear weapons, were in a standoff during the Cold War. The fear of complete destruction in the event of a nuclear conflict was known as \"Mutually Assured Destruction\". This fear meant that if one side were to initiate a nuclear attack, the other side would retaliate, leading to devastating consequences for both parties and potentially the entire world. As a result, people around the globe lived with the constant threat of nuclear annihilation, which had a profound impact on global politics, security policies, and everyday life.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. The essayist says ‘While there is science, there is hope of survival and well-being for all of us.’ Explain it.</strong></p><p>The essayist's statement, \"While there is science, there is hope of survival and well-being for all of us,\" suggests that scientific knowledge and research have the potential to address the challenges and problems facing humanity. Science provides solutions, innovations, and advancements that can improve the quality of life, prevent disasters, and promote well-being. It signifies the idea that as long as science exists, there is a source of knowledge and ingenuity that can be harnessed to tackle issues such as disease, environmental crises, and technological challenges. Science offers hope for a better future through its ability to create solutions and improve the human condition.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Is science a blessing or a curse? Write an essay on it.</strong></p><p>Science plays a vital role in society, shaping the world we live in and influencing various aspects of our lives. It has brought about remarkable advancements in healthcare, technology, and agriculture. However, along with its blessings, science has also brought forth challenges and ethical dilemmas. </p><p><br /></p><p>Science has been a blessing to humanity in numerous ways. It has revolutionized healthcare, leading to the development of life-saving treatments, vaccines, and surgical procedures. Diseases that were once fatal are now manageable, and global life expectancy has increased significantly.</p><p><br /></p><p>Technological advancements have transformed our lives, making communication faster and more accessible. The internet, smartphones, and other devices have connected people worldwide, facilitating the exchange of knowledge and ideas. Moreover, science has improved transportation, providing efficient means of travel and enabling the exploration of new frontiers. In agriculture, scientific innovations have enhanced food production and improved crop yields, ensuring food security for a growing global population. </p><p><br /></p><p>Despite its many benefits, science has also brought forth negative consequences. Environmental degradation, fueled by industrialization and technological advancements, poses a significant challenge. Pollution, deforestation, and climate change are some of the pressing issues that demand urgent attention.</p><p><br /></p><p>The misuse of scientific knowledge and technology for destructive purposes is another concern. The development of nuclear weapons during the Cold War era created a global fear of annihilation. Additionally, advancements in biotechnology raise ethical dilemmas, such as the potential for genetic manipulation and the creation of designer babies.</p><p><br /></p><p>With great power comes great responsibility. Scientists and policymakers have a crucial role in ensuring that scientific advancements are used for the benefit of humanity. Ethical considerations must be at the forefront of scientific research and application.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

"reward": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>The essay talks about why some people choose careers in science despite lower incomes compared to other fields like business, law, etc.</p><p><br /></p><p>A famous writer Tolstoy said that a writer cannot live without writing, similarly a scientist cannot live without doing science. The major rewards for a scientist come from discoveries themselves.</p><p><br /></p><p>As a scientist, one gets freedom, camaraderie, independence and sense of accomplishment from uncovering nature's mysteries.</p><p><br /></p><p>The essay shares an episode from author's life where he was called to help solve a technical problem related to detection of underground nuclear explosions.</p><p><br /></p><p>Scientists from opposite sides of cold war had to find a solution which seemed impossible due to political and cultural differences.</p><p><br /></p><p>They were able to solve it as they had a common language of science based on evidence and expertise rather than political or cultural backgrounds.</p><p><br /></p><p>This helped politicians eventually reach an important decision of nuclear test ban. The episode taught the author that scientists worldwide think alike and one is never lonely abroad as long as there is science.</p><p><br /></p><p>Though seen as lacking practical sense, scientists are actually most practical as all new technologies stem from fundamental research. Basic science research is crucial to tackle challenges of survival like disasters, energy, health, environment, etc.</p><p><br /></p><p>Further, the essay states that humanity's survival depends on addressing natural and man-made disasters through basic research to develop new ways to prevent and reduce risks. Only scientists and their tools can ensure safe progress is possible.</p><p><br /></p><p>In summary, the essay explores the non-money rewards of being a scientist and shows how basic research has real benefits for global issues like stopping nuclear bombs and making disasters less harmful. It says scientific cooperation is key to overcoming political differences for humanity's benefit.</p><p><br /></p>"

    "story": "<p><strong>Trifles</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Written by The SR Zone | Shriram Lamichhane</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Exercise</strong></p><p>Understanding of the text</p><p><strong>Answer the following question</strong></p><p><strong>a. Do you believe that Mrs. Wright killed her husband? Explain.</strong></p><p>In \"Trifles,\" Mrs. Wright is suspected of killing her husband, and there are indications that she may have had a motive. However, whether one believes she is guilty or not can vary. Some readers may believe she killed him, possibly due to years of abuse and isolation, while others may sympathize with her and argue that her actions were a response to her oppressive circumstances. It's a matter of interpretation.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Do you think Mr. Wright’s death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn’t stopped by the Wrights’ home?</strong></p><p>I think that because Mr. Hale happened to visit that day, he discovered what had happened and informed the authorities. Their house was very far from the road, with few people ever stopping by. Since very few people came to the house, she may have been able to hide the body without anyone finding out. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Why does Mrs. Hale think that Mrs. Wright’s worries about her preserves indicate her innocence?</strong></p><p>Mrs. Hale believes that Mrs. Wright's worries about her preserves indicate her innocence because it reflects her dedication to her household duties and her nature. This makes it seem unlikely that she would commit murder.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. How does Mrs. Peters’ homesteading experience connect her to Mrs. Wright?</strong></p><p>Mrs. Peters' homesteading experience connects her to Mrs. Wright in the sense that both women have lived in isolated rural environments. This experience allows Mrs. Peters to empathize with the loneliness and challenges that Mrs. Wright may have faced as a rural homemaker. It gives Mrs. Peters a deeper understanding of the isolation and hardships that can come with rural life, which contributes to her sympathy for Mrs. Wright.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. How do the women’s perspectives on men differ?</strong></p><p>In \"Trifles,\" the women, Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters, have a different perspective on men compared to the male characters. The women are more empathetic and understanding of the challenges faced by Mrs. Wright, who was isolated and mistreated by her husband. They believe that men often overlook the struggles and emotional needs of women, while the male characters dismiss the women's concerns as unimportant \"trifles.\" This contrast in perspectives highlights the gender roles and the societal expectations of the time.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Reference to the text</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>a. Read the excerpts from the play provided below and answer the questions that follow.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>a. “MRS. PETERS : (glancing about). Seems odd to think of a bird here. But she must have had one, otherwise why would she have a cage?</strong>&nbsp;I wonder what happened to it? MRS. HALE : I s'pose maybe the cat got it.\"</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>i. Who does 'she' refer to?</strong></p><p>Mrs. Wright is referred to as 'She' in the sentence.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ii. What does the term 'one' stand for?</strong></p><p>A bird is represented by the word 'one.'</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iii. What is the complete form of “s'pose”</strong></p><p>It's \"suppose\" for \"s'pose.\"</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iv. What do you mean when Mrs. Hale says, “the cat got it?</strong>?</p><p>Mrs. Hale means \"the cat killed the bird\" when she says \"the cat got it.\"</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. “MRS. HALE : Wright was near...... she used to wear beautiful clothing and be vivacious, when she was Minnie Foster, one of the town girls singing in the choir. But then, well, that was thirty years ago.”</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>i. Why does Mrs. Hale refer to Mrs. Wright as “Minnie Foster”?</strong></p><p>Hale calls Mrs. Wright \"Minnie Foster\" because her name was Minnie Foster before marriage.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ii. What does her description tell you about Mrs. Wright?</strong></p><p>According to Mrs. Wright's description, she was a talented vocalist before she married. She used to go by the name Minnie Foster and perform as a singer in gorgeous dresses.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iii. What does Mrs. Hale imply by “that was thirty years ago”?</strong></p><p>When Mrs. Hale says \"that was thirty years ago,\" she's referring to Mrs. Wright's time as a famous singer known as Minnie Foster when she was unmarried.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What is the main theme of the play?</strong></p><p>The main theme of \"Trifles\" by Susan Glaspell is the oppression of women in a male-dominated society and the consequences of this oppression. The play explores the lives of rural women who are isolated and marginalized, highlighting the ways in which they are often ignored or dismissed by men. It also shows the theme of justice, suggesting that sometimes the law may not serve the true justice.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Discuss the symbolism utilised in the play.</strong></p><p>Trifles\" makes use of symbolism to convey its themes. </p><p>-The dead canary in a birdcage symbolizes Mrs. Wright's life and her emotional state. The canary, which used to sing but was strangled, represents her own silenced voice and the loss of her happiness.</p><p>-The broken preserves jars symbolize the sudden disruption of Mrs. Wright's domestic life and her emotional turmoil.</p><p>-The quilt, with its uneven stitching, symbolizes the imperfections in Mrs. Wright's life.</p><p>-The birdcage itself symbolizes the figurative imprisonment of Mrs. Wright in her marriage.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Discuss the setting of the play. Does it have an effect on the topic of the play?</strong></p><p>\"Trifles\" takes place in an old farmhouse in the countryside during the early 1900s. This isolated location represents how women felt trapped and alone in a society controlled by men. The farmhouse represents Mrs. Wright's restricted and suffocating existence, where she is disconnected from the world outside. It also shows that the women, who are ofte busy in the household environment, can find important clues that the men overlook. The setting highlights the limited lives and emotional struggles of the female.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference beyond the text</p><p><strong>a. The believability of a character is decided not just by the individual's ideas and deeds but also by what other characters say and think about him or her. Discuss in connection to the characters in Trifles.</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>In \"Trifles,\" different viewpoints of the male and female characters highlight the theme of gender roles and how societal expectations influence credibility. It shows that credibility can be shaped not only by a person's own actions but also by how others perceive and understand them.</p><p><br /></p><p>The male characters, such as Mr. Hale, Mr. Peters, and the County Attorney, don't take Mrs. Wright seriously. They see her as unimportant and think that her concerns are \"trifles\". They focus on gathering evidence for the murder case and overlook Mrs. Wright's thoughts and emotions. Their dismissive attitude affects how they perceive her credibility.</p><p><br /></p><p>On the other hand, the female characters, Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters, have a different perspective. They understand the challenges of rural life and can empathize with Mrs. Wright. They believe that her actions and emotions are justified considering the difficult circumstances she faces. Their understanding and support enhance Mrs. Wright's credibility and make her a more sympathetic character.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Dramatic irony happens when the reader or audience knows knowledge that is unknown to the characters in a play; it generates tension and suspense. Analyse the play analysing the author's use of dramatic irony based on these questions :</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>What information is crucial to the play Trifles?</strong></p><p>The crucial information in \"Trifles\" is the motive behind Mr. Wright's murder and the evidence that points to Mrs. Wright's guilt.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>How does the playwright use this information to create dramatic irony?</strong></p><p>The playwright creates dramatic irony by letting the audience know crucial information that the male characters are unaware of. The audience learns about Mrs. Wright's motive, her emotional state, and the broken preserves jars, all of which provide insights into her possible guilt or innocence.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>What effect does the dramatic irony have on the audience and on the play?</strong></p><p>The dramatic irony creates tension and suspense for the audience. As they know more than the male characters, they become emotionally invested in uncovering the truth. It also allows the audience to sympathize with Mrs. Wright and question the actions and attitudes of the male characters. The dramatic irony ultimately contributes to the play's exploration of justice and gender roles.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

They are joined by Mr. Hale, a neighbor. Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters also come to help but the men do not think the women are needed.</p><p><br /></p><p>As the play opens, Glaspell creates a sense of isolation through the neglected state of the kitchen and broken bird cage.

Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale start to empathize with her hard situation being alone with her husband all the time.</p><p><br /></p><p>In the end, the women decide to hide the evidence they found as they understand Mrs. Wright's years of suffering led her to kill her husband. They also remember how happy mrs wright used to be before her marriage with a passion in singing. But, after marriage, she only dealt with depression and marital tensions. So, they want to protect her rather than see her punished. However, when the men return they only focus on objective facts and fail to grasp the emotional context uncovered by the women.</p><p><br /></p><p>The play challenges the traditional gender roles of the time by showing how the women's attention to small details provides insight into solving the crime. It also examines themes of isolation, fairness in justice, and how perspectives of women are often overlooked.

We can feel sad and happy for them at the same time. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>h. Discuss how the play is built around humour and irony.</strong></p><p>The play is funny in how the characters Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo pretend to be different people. This causes silly mistakes and confused moments. They used to love each other very much, but now they don't even know who the other person is because of their disguises.

Now that their true identities will be out in the open, they may talk about their past relationship and how they used to be in love. They will likely feel nostalgic and happy, but also maybe sad about the time they spent apart. This reunion could bring them emotionally closer as they discuss their feelings. It may resolve all the confusion that has happened so far from pretending to be different people. Learning the whole story about each other could lead them to reconnect in a deep way. The play has been hinting at this reveal, so their meeting will likely be an important moment where everything comes to light between them.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Was it wise for Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo to keep their identities secret? How might their secrets affect future meetings?</strong></p><p>Keeping their identities secret initially allowed Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo to enjoy a fresh start and escape from their troubled pasts. However, their secrets have also led to misunderstandings and missed opportunities for reconnection. In future meetings, now that they have recognized each other, their secrets may no longer be necessary. Instead, they can openly discuss their shared history and their feelings.

    "story": "<p><strong>Unit 3 Refund</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Written by The SR Zone | Shriram Lamichhane</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Understanding the text</strong></p><p>Answer the following Questions</p><p><strong>a. Why does Wasserkopf demand a refund of his tuition fees from the school?</strong></p><p>Wasserkopf demands a tuition refund from the school because he believes the money he spent on education wasn’t worth it as it left him unprepared for life. He feels that he has learned nothing and has no useful knowledge to show for the money he paid in tuition.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Why does Wasserkopf consider himself good for nothing?</strong></p><p>Wasserkopf considers himself good at nothing because he was always rejected on job applications and unable to do nothing great.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. What did the teachers decide to do when Wasserkopf asked for a refund?</strong></p><p>The professors decided to take a re-examination of him and pass him in all subjects even if he gives wrong answers. They came to the conclusion that they should collaboratively work with each other in defending the refund demand of Wasserkopf.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. Why did Wasserkopf give ridiculous answers? Why did the teachers accept these answers?</strong></p><p>He gave ridiculous answers in order to fail and be eligible for refund. His answers were accepted by the professors they wanted to prove him wrong and demonstrate that he had indeed learned something during his time at the school to avoid the refund that he was asking for.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>e. How does the Mathematics Master describe Wasserkopf’s character?</strong></p><p>The Mathematical Master sees Wasserkopf as someone who is clever at manipulating situations to his advantage. The Master believes Wasserkopf will use any strategy to get back the money he paid for his education. He thinks Wasserkopf is tricky and will do a lot to regain his refund.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>f. How did the teachers outwit Wasserkopf?</strong></p><p>The professors tricked Wasserkopf using reverse psychology. They asked him very easy questions to make him think he passed the test. But Wasserkopf defended that with his wrong answers with silly justifications. Finally, math teacher admitted Wasserkopf failed. He asked Wasserkopf to calculate how much the school owed him in refund. Wasserkopf correctly gave the exact refund amount. The math professors said Wasserkopf must be a math genius to solve such a hard refund problem. They announced he passed the test. In the end, the teachers were cleverer than Wasserkopf by using his own tricks against him through their psychological tactics and difficult math question.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>g. What is the final judgment on Waserkopf’s demand for refund?</strong></p><p>The final judgment on Wasserkopf's demand for a refund is that he is deserving for the certificate that he was awarded during graduation. The teachers successfully demonstrate to him that he has indeed learned valuable knowledge during his time at the school, and he leaves with a newfound appreciation for his education.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Reference to the text</strong></p><p>a. Read the extract from the play given below and answer the questions that follow: “It’s possible I’ve changed. What the hell…! Your class records will show I’ve got a right to come here.”</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>i. Who is the speaker? Who is he speaking to?</strong></p><p>Wasserkopf is the speaker. He's speaking to the principal of his former school.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ii. Why does the speaker say these words?</strong></p><p>The speaker expresses his dissatisfaction with his former school's academic results, which he earned eighteen years ago, by saying these words.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iii. Where is the speaker at this moment?</strong></p><p>The speaker is in the Principal's office at this moment.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Read the extract dialogue given below and Ans the questions that follow:</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>i. What is the answer to ‘How do you do?</strong>’</p><p>'I am fine' is the answer to 'How do you do'.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>ii. Is Wasserkopf’s answer polite enough to the staff?</strong></p><p>Wasserkopf's response is not polite. He responds with rudeness, telling the staff to sit down and calling them \"loafers.\"</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iii. How does Wasserkopf rebuke the staff?</strong></p><p>Wasserkopf rebukes the staff by using disrespectful language and addressing them with contempt.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>iv. What does the principal mean by ‘How dare you -’?</strong></p><p>The principal's statement, \"How dare you -,\" indicates his shock and displeasure at Wasserkopf's disrespectful behavior. It suggests that Wasserkopf's response was completely inappropriate and disrespectful towards the staff.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Explain the following line of the play: “Because I didn’t get my money’s worth, that’s why!”</strong></p><p>The line \"Because I didn't get my money's worth, that's why!\" reflects Wasserkopf's primary motivation for demanding a refund of his tuition fees. He believes that he did not receive the education and knowledge he expected for the money he paid. Wasserkopf is dissatisfied with the quality of education provided by the school, and he feels cheated, which is why he insists on a refund.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>d. What is the theme of the play?</strong></p><p>The play \"Refund\" is full of comedy and satire which covers the theme of &nbsp;value of theoretical knowledge and raises questions about the practical applicability of education. The writer criticises the present educational system, which does not prepare students for a career. It also shows teacher's ability to manage the problem without compromising their school's image.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>E. Sketch the character of Wasserkopf.</strong></p><p>Wasserkopf is a smart and tricky person who uses silly and clever tricks to try and get his money back for his school fees. He's not happy with the education he got and thinks it wasn't worth the money he paid. He is really quick-thinking and creative. During exams, he gives silly answers to confuse the teachers. He believes he deserves refund and is really determined to prove his point. But he can also be really arrogant and doesn't show respect to people in authority. In general, Wasserkopf is a complicated character who surprises both the teachers and the audience with his actions.</p><p><br /></p><p>Reference beyond the text</p><p><strong>a. The play is a satire on the present day education system. Do you think that our education system does not prepare students for life?</strong>&nbsp;Discuss.</p><p><br /></p><p>The current education system does not properly prepare students for real life challenges. Many people today are well educated but lack practical skills. Schools focus more on theoretical learning than teaching creativity and problem-solving needed in real jobs. There is a disconnect between what is taught and the demands of the real world. This results in graduates who are not very productive in workplaces. They also lack leadership abilities since education did not give real world experience. Students are not adequately equipped for adulthood because school does not mirror reality.</p><p><br /></p><p>In short, the education system over-emphasizes academics over life skills training. This leaves graduates unprepared for challenges of the real world. Better alignment is needed between education and practical career demands.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>b. Our education system focuses on memorisation rather than creative thinking. Do you think the knowledge imparted by education may not have practical relevance in one’s day-to-day life?&nbsp;Who do you blame for this?</strong></p><p>I feel our educational system is accountable for the knowledge obtained in school which cannot be utilised in real life. Education and associated information are distant from creative thinking in today's educational system. The courses are constructed in such a way that they have no practical use in everyday life.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Students are searching for an easier method of remembering than using their creative thinking. This is the consequence of the present educational system, which has resulted in the passivation of thousands of people's brains. Students seem to be working hard to improve their grades in a number of different ways. They concentrate only on getting good grades and obtaining certificates without using their own creativity.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>c. Most of the students want to learn just for examination rather than knowledge. Do you think that certificate will help them in their future career?</strong></p><p>Today, the majority of students graduate via shady methods. They're more likely to be seen working hard to memorize the sentences and formulae when it comes to the last two or three months of the test. They spend most of their time preparing for tests, not gaining meaningful knowledge. In the future, there will be a lack of real skills and talents as certificates don't guarantee abilities. If students only prepare for exams and don't properly learn, they won't be qualified for jobs. Relying on tricks to pass tests produces graduates without real-world applicable skills. This quick fix approach results in unproductive members of society long-term. Proper learning is important, not just getting good grades through memorization.</p><p><br /></p><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

They agree to refund him, but only if he fails a test. Wasserkopf accepts. His math, science, geography and other teachers question him. He purposely gives wrong answers to show he learned nothing.</p><p><br /></p><p>The teachers try to prove he knows the answers. Finally, the math teacher says Wasserkopf's last answer is wrong. Now they must refund him according to their deal. They ask how much the refund should be. Wasserkopf calculates it correctly.</p><p><br /></p><p>The math teacher says Wasserkopf passed the math test by solving the calculation problem well. This shows the teachers taught him math skills.
