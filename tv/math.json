      "reward" : "<h3>Writing I&nbsp;</h3><h3>The use of Al in the technology is not only making people's liveseasier but bringing new challenges. Write a newspaper article about the challenges brought by the advancement of AI in technology.</h3> <p>Title: The Rise of AI in Technology: Facing Challenges Together</p><p>July 22nd, Kathmandu Post</p><p>In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm, changing how we live, work, and interact. From helpful virtual assistants on our phones to decision-making algorithms, AI has made life easier in many ways. But with these advancements come important challenges that we need to understand and address.</p><p>Job Concerns: Some worry that AI might take over jobs, leaving people unemployed. While AI can do repetitive tasks, it also creates new job opportunities. We must adapt our skills to fit this changing job landscape.</p><p>Privacy and Security: AI relies on lots of data, raising concerns about our privacy. Companies and governments must use data responsibly, protecting our personal information from misuse and theft.</p><p>Fairness Matters: AI algorithms learn from past data, and if that data is biased, it can make unfair decisions. This could affect important areas like hiring and justice. We need to make sure AI is fair and doesn't perpetuate inequalities.</p><p>Tough Choices: AI is now used in areas that raise ethical dilemmas. For example, self-driving cars must make tough decisions during emergencies. We need clear guidelines on how AI should handle these situations.</p><p>Rules and Safety: AI is growing fast, and rules are struggling to keep up. We must find a balance between encouraging innovation and ensuring safety to avoid potential misuse.</p><p>Working Together: AI is powerful, but it can't replace human creativity and empathy. Finding the right balance between AI and humans is essential to maintain human values.</p><p><b>Conclusion:</b></p><p>AI offers exciting possibilities, but it also brings challenges. We must work together – policymakers, industry leaders, and ethicists – to use AI responsibly and ethically. By balancing innovation, regulation, and ethics, we can create a better world where AI serves us while preserving what makes us human.</p> <p><br /></p>"

It is considered the world's largest food fight!</p><p>The festival began in 1945 when a spontaneous tomato fight broke out among youth in the town plaza. Since then it has grown into a major tourist attraction, drawing over 30,000 participants from around the world every year.</p><p>At around 11 am on the day of La Tomatina, a truck loaded with tomatoes enters the town plaza where participants are waiting. As soon as the truck stops, a countdown begins and participants rush to grab as many tomatoes as they can. For the next 1-2 hours, a massive tomato-throwing frenzy ensues! People throw tomatoes at each other, town structures, even climbing onto rooftops to launch tomatoes from above. The entire town plaza is turned into a slippery sea of red pulp.</p><p>After the tomato fight ends, fire trucks arrive and spray down the plaza, washing away the tomato remains. The festival concludes with traditional dancing and music.</p><p>To participate, one must purchase a official ticket which includes provision of protective eyewear, a T-shirt and access to public showers afterwards. Many attendees wear swimsuits, gloves and goggles for protection during the event.</p><p>So in summary, La Tomatina is a unique festival that allows participants to let loose, get messy and indulge in carefree tomato-throwing madness for a brief time, after which order is restored! It's certainly a once-in-a-lifetime experience of good fun and huge food wastage.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Grammar - I</h2> <h3>A. Change the following sentences into indirect speech.

      "reward" : " <h2>Writing I</h2> <h3>Write an essay describing a festival which is celebrated in your community. Include its brief history, people involved, major activities, religious or social importance, duration, and drawbacks, if any.</h3> <p>Dashain: A Festival of Harmony and Unity</p> <p>Dashain is a significant Hindu festival celebrated in my community with great enthusiasm and joy. It usually falls in September or October and lasts for 15 days. This festival holds a special place in our hearts as it brings families and friends together in a spirit of love and harmony.</p><p>Dashain has its roots in ancient mythology and is dedicated to the goddess Durga, symbolizing victory over evil. According to Hindu legends, the goddess Durga defeated the demon Mahishasura during this time, signifying the triumph of good over evil.</p><p>During Dashain, people of all ages participate in various activities and rituals. One of the major activities is the worship of goddess Durga and the offering of animal sacrifices, mainly goats and buffaloes, as a symbolic gesture of devotion.</p><p>Families come together to prepare delicious feasts, share gifts, and exchange blessings. Elders bless the younger members of the family, and this reinforces the bond between generations.</p><p>The festival also includes kite-flying, playing traditional games, and singing and dancing. People wear new clothes and visit relatives and friends to exchange greetings and best wishes.</p><p>Dashain holds both religious and social significance. It is a time of reflection, gratitude, and renewal of faith. The festival fosters a sense of unity and cultural heritage among the community members.</p><p>However, there are some drawbacks associated with Dashain, particularly concerning the use of animal sacrifices. While it has deep religious significance for some, there is growing awareness about animal welfare and ethical considerations. Some people choose to celebrate Dashain without sacrificing animals to promote a more compassionate and humane approach.</p><p>Overall, Dashain is a vibrant and cherished festival in our community, bringing happiness, blessings, and cultural richness to our lives. It is a time when we come together as a community to celebrate our traditions and values. As an 8th-grade student, I look forward to Dashain every year and cherish the memories created during this special time with my family and friends.</p> <p><br /></p>"

Answer the following questions.</h3><div><div><b>a. What was the nightmare for the author?</b></div><div>Answer: The author's nightmare was when their nine-week-old baby developed an extremely high fever, and they had to rush to the hospital for medical care.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>b. What do you think the main purpose of this letter is?</b></div><div>Answer: The main purpose of this letter is to share the author's experience at the hospital and express their concerns about the way some of the hospital staff behaved and communicated during their baby's stay.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>c. According to the author, what was the main weakness of the hospital staff?</b></div><div>Answer: According to the author, the main weakness of the hospital staff was that they were too focused on their own needs and skills, rather than prioritizing the care of the sick baby.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>d. Did the nurses really say 'your daughter is not a priority'? Why did the author think so?</b></div><div>Answer: No, the nurses didn't directly say 'your daughter is not a priority.' The author interpreted their repeated statement of \"I am so busy today\" as implying that the baby wasn't a priority for them, which made the author feel concerned about their baby's care.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>e. What do the patients and their families expect from the health workers?</b></div><div>Answer: Patients and their families expect health workers to be caring, attentive, and focused on providing the best possible care for the patients.

According to the author, how do people perceive the career of health workers?</b></div><div>Answer: According to the author, people perceive the career of health workers as a job that involves taking care of sick people and helping them get well. However, the author points out that how health workers treat each other can influence patients' experience in the hospital.</div></div><div><br /></div> <h3>D. If you become a health worker in the future, what would be your priority? How would you treat your patients and their families?</h3> <p>If I become a health worker, my priorities would be kindness and compassion for all patients. I would strive to truly listen to them, show empathy and treat them with dignity and respect. I would ensure clear communication with family members, keeping them informed in a sensitive yet transparent way. Clinically, I would follow evidence-based practices and apply the latest medical knowledge. But I would not neglect the simple human connection with patients, checking in on their mental health and emotions, not just physical symptoms. A caring bedside manner can itself be healing. If I were a health worker, I would treat every patient as I would want a loved one to be treated - with kindness, competence and care for their whole person.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Grammar I Reported Speech</h2> <h3>B.

Draft a short speech entitled, ‘Importance of Exercise for Healthy Life’.</h4> <p>Good morning everyone. Today I would like to talk about the importance of exercise for leading a healthy and happy life.</p><p>Exercise is any physical activity that helps improve your physical fitness and health. This includes activities like walking, jogging, swimming, cycling, playing sports and even doing household chores. Regular exercise has tremendous benefits for our physical and mental wellbeing.</p><p>First and foremost, exercise helps control weight. When we exercise, our body burns calories and excess body fat. This helps maintain a healthy weight and reduces the risk of obesity.</p><p>Regular exercise also improves cardiovascular health. It lowers blood pressure, reduces cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and decreases the risk of heart disease and stroke.</p><p>Exercise strengthens muscles and bones. It improves muscle tone, strength and endurance. It also increases bone density and reduces the risk of osteoporosis.</p><p>Beyond physical benefits, exercise also improves mental health. It reduces stress and anxiety, lifts mood by releasing feel-good hormones like endorphins, and helps fight depression. It even improves cognitive functions and delays age-related decline.</p><p>In a nutshell, exercise is medicine for both body and mind. It promotes overall fitness, health and wellbeing. Even moderate exercise done regularly can significantly lower the risk of many chronic diseases. So make exercise a part of your daily routine for a longer, happier and healthier life.</p><p>To conclude, I urge everyone to find some form of physical activity you enjoy and make time for it every day. Our health and wellbeing truly depend on it. Thank you.</p> <p><br /></p> <h2>Grammar II</h2> <h3>A. Circle the correct words to complete these sentences.</h3> <p>a.

Let us examine some key aspects of this complex problem.</p><p>Obesity refers to having excessive body fat that poses serious health risks. A person with a Body Mass Index of 30 or higher is considered obese.</p><p>Over 650 million adults worldwide are currently obese. In some countries, over 30% of the adult population is affected. Childhood obesity rates have also tripled in recent decades.</p><p>Obesity greatly increases the risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, fatty liver disease and some cancers. It is a leading cause of premature death worldwide.</p><p>Various factors like genetics, lifestyle changes, unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, mental health issues and hormonal imbalances all play a role in obesity.</p><p>On an individual level, we must adopt a balanced diet low in calories and high in nutrition. We should aim for at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day. On a societal scale, we need policies that promote health education, access to nutritious food and walkable neighborhoods.</p><p>In conclusion, obesity is a complex, mulitfactorial health crisis. While individual efforts matter, we also need social and environmental changes to make healthy lifestyles the easier default for everyone.

      "story" : "<h2>Unit 4 : Reading - II&nbsp;</h2><h2>Leave this Chanting and Singing</h2><div><div><br /></div><div>Written by The SR Zone | Shriram Lamichhane</div><div><br /></div></div> <p><b>Summary</b>&nbsp;</p><p>The poem encourages the reader to abandon rituals like chanting, singing, and counting beads in worship. It questions the idea of finding God in a closed-off temple and suggests that God is present everywhere, even in the mundane tasks of life, like tilling the ground and breaking stones.&nbsp;</p><p>The poet urges the reader to come down from the pedestal of holiness, join others in their struggles, and embrace the joys and challenges of life together. The poem emphasizes that true deliverance or spiritual freedom is not separate from the world but found in embracing life's bonds and connecting with others.</p><p>In short, the poem advises us to move away from rituals, see the divine in everyday life, and find deliverance in connecting with others.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Exercise</h2> <h3>A. Find the words from the poem which have the following meanings.</h3> <p>a. a small piece of glass or stone threaded with others to make a necklace.........</p> <p>beads</p> <p>b. to prepare and use the land for growing crops.........</p> <p>tile</p> <p>c. a piece of clothing .........</p> <p>garment</p> <p>d. a layer of something that covers a surface .........</p> <p>mantle</p> <p>e. the state of being rescued from danger, evil or pain..........</p> <p>deliverance</p> <p>f. a substance that produces a pleasant smell when you burn it .........</p> <p>incense</p> <p>g. covered with marks.........</p> <p>stained</p> <p>h. hard unpleasant work that makes you very tired.........</p> <p>toil</p><p><br /></p> <h3>B. Find the modern equivalents of the following archaic words used in the poem.</h3> <p>a. dost - do</p> <p>b. thou -you</p> <p>c. thine-yours</p> <p>d. thy-your</p><p><br /></p> <h3>C. Answer the following questions.</h3><p><b>a. Who is the poem addressed to?</b></p><p>Answer: The poem is not explicitly addressed to a specific individual. It is more of a general message to the readers who engage in chanting, singing, and telling beads in a temple with closed doors.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>b. What does the speaker advise people?</b></p><p>Answer: The speaker advises people to leave behind traditional rituals like chanting, singing, and counting beads in their worship.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>c. Where do people try to find the god?</b></p><p>Answer: People try to find God in a lonely dark corner of a temple with closed doors.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>d. Where, according to the speaker, does the god actually reside?</b></p><p>Answer: According to the speaker, God actually resides in the world, where people toil and work. He is present in the everyday tasks like tilling the ground and breaking stones.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>e. How can people have a glimpse of the god?</b></p><p>Answer: People can have a glimpse of God by being engaged in the world, embracing the struggles of life, and connecting with others.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>f. Why can't the god rescue people?</b></p><p>Answer: The poem suggests that God doesn't rescue people because He has willingly taken on the bonds of creation and is bound with all living beings forever. He shares in their joys and struggles.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>g. What does the speaker ask people to do in the last stanza?</b></p><p>Answer: In the last stanza, the speaker asks people to come out of their meditations and leave aside their flowers and incense. Instead, they should meet and stand by others, work hard, and sweat on their brows just like God does in the world.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>D. Do you believe in the existence of god? What do you do to please him? Share your opinion.</b></p><p>I do believe in the existence of God. For me, God represents the highest power of goodness, love and truth in the universe. I believe God created this magnificent world we live in, filled with beauty, diversity and complexity that boggles the mind. The very fact that something exists rather than nothing is, for me, proof enough that a supernatural force or consciousness must be behind it all.</p><p>To please God, I try my best to be a good person and live according to divine principles. I try to be kind, honest and compassionate in my dealings with others. I try not to hurt anyone through my words or actions. I help those in need whenever I can. I try to let go of greed, envy, hatred and other vices that distance me from the divine. I make an effort to live in the present moment with gratitude for the gifts I've been given.</p><p>I do not claim to have any proof of God's existence beyond my own intuition and experience. But I find faith and spirituality give meaning and purpose to my life. They motivate me to be a better version of myself. And ultimately, that is what matters most - living in a way that uplifts others and contributes to the greater good.</p><p>So in short, I do believe in God. Not a rigid dogmatic version of God, but a higher consciousness of truth, love and beauty that pervades all of creation. And I try my best to align my own consciousness with that divine spirit through living an ethical, purposeful life.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Grammar Il</h2> <h3>A.

Complete the sentences with the correct words or phrases from the text.</h3> <p>a. Water bubbles break down if vapour pressure inside and outside the bubbles is equal.</p> <p>b. As the altitude goes up, the boiling point of water decreases.</p> <p>c. Random motion of molecules or particles is called thermal motion.</p> <p>d. If the door does not open, try pushing the key in the lock.</p> <p>e. Certain chemicals can induce undesirable changes in the nervous system.</p><p><br /></p> <h3>C. Answer these questions.</h3> <p><b>a. What is the speed of the water particles compared with?</b></p><p>Answer: The speed of the water particles is compared with the thermal motion of tiny balls, representing the water molecules.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>b. How are bubbles formed in the boiling water?</b></p><p>Answer: Bubbles are formed in boiling water when the temperature increases, and water molecules gain enough energy to push back other water molecules in the liquid, creating pockets of water vapor (gas phase).</p><p><br /></p><p><b>c. Mention two things on which external pressure depends.</b></p><p>Answer: External pressure depends on the altitude above sea level and the surrounding atmospheric conditions.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>d. How is the atmosphere related to the pressure of water?</b></p><p>Answer: The atmosphere influences the pressure of water because the atmospheric pressure pushes on the liquid water. When the pressure inside the bubbles (vapor pressure) becomes equal to the outside pressure (atmospheric pressure), the water boils.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>e. What would happen if the atmospheric pressure on the liquid water was decreased?</b></p><p>Answer: If the atmospheric pressure on the liquid water was decreased, the pressure inside the bubbles (vapor pressure) would also decrease. This would make it easier for the water particles to break away and form bubbles without requiring a high temperature. Water could boil at lower temperatures, even at room temperature.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>f. What would the experimenter gain if she pulled the plunger out?</b></p><p>Answer: If the experimenter pulled the plunger out, she would decrease the pressure inside the syringe (liquid water). As a result, the water molecules would gain enough energy to form boiling bubbles, and the water would start to boil, even without increasing the temperature significantly.</p><p><br /></p> <h3>D. What would happen on the Earth if there were no gravity?&nbsp;</h3> <p>If there were no gravity on Earth, everything would float away into space. Buildings and trees would fly up into the sky. We wouldn't have rain or rivers because water wouldn't stay on Earth. We wouldn't be able to walk or stay in one place. Life as we know it would be completely different and challenging, like living in a big space adventure without gravity holding us down. People, objects, and even the air around us would have no force to keep them on the ground. It would be like being in a giant spaceship with no floor to stand on.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Grammar I</h2> <h3>A. Match the clauses with their appropriate continuation.</h3> <p>a.

The poet talks to the rain and asks who it is. The rain replies that it is the song of the Earth. The rain says that it brings happiness to the Earth.</p><p>The rain is always falling, sometimes heavy and sometimes light. It starts as water vapor in the air and becomes clouds in the sky. Even though it changes shapes, it stays the same water. It implies that some parts of nature cannot be fully understood.</p><p>The raindrops fall from the sky and wash away dust. They quench the thirst of the dry Earth and make everything that was dull come alive again. In other words, the rain makes the Earth pure and beautiful.</p><p>Finally, the poet sees that the rain is like a song. A song can also calm, heal, change and thrill people. In the same way, the rain cycles of evaporating and condensing purifies the water. It makes the whole earth as beautiful as rhythm makes a poem or music.</p><p><br /></p> <h3>A.

Complete the summary of the poem using suitable words or phrases given below.</h3> <p>[quenches, rhythm, mysterious, heal, atomies, condensation, ascends, showers, originality]</p> <p>The poem is a conversation between the poet and the rain. When the poet asks about the identity of the drizzle, she replies that she is the poem of the Earth. The rain expresses that it gives happiness to Mother Earth.</p> <p>The rain is a perpetual process which has different forms at different times. It rises from the land as water vapour and ascends high up to the sky. It takes the form of clouds. Though it changes its form or shape, its originality remains unchanged. It shows that nature is not fully understood. Some parts of it always remain mysterious.</p> <p>The raindrops pour down from above to wash away atomizes and dust layers. It quenches the thirst of the dry Earth and heals everything that is becoming lifeless. In other words, the showers make the Earth pure and beautiful.</p> <p>Finally, the poet observes that the life of rain is similar to that of a song. A song also has the power to calm, heal, transform and thrill. In the same way, repeated evaporation and condensation purifies the rain. It beautifies the whole earth as a rhythm does to a poem or a music.</p><p><br /></p> <h3>D. Answer the following questions.</h3> <h4>a. What are the two voices in the poem? Who do they belong to?</h4><h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Answer: The two voices in the poem are the voice of the rain and the voice of the speaker (Walt Whitman).</span></h4><h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><br /></span></h4><h4>b. How is the cycle movement of the rain shown in the poem?</h4><h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Answer: The poem shows the cycle movement of rain through its description of the rain starting as a delicate pattern, growing louder into a mighty torrent, and then singing and murmuring as it falls, showcasing the various forms and sounds of rain.</span></h4><h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><br /></span></h4><h4>c. Why are the showers necessary for the Earth?</h4><h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Answer: The showers are necessary for the Earth because they bring life and vitality to plants and animals, cleanse and purify the air and the earth, and help in the growth of nature.</span></h4><h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><br /></span></h4><h4>d. How are the rain and music similar?</h4><h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Answer: Rain and music are similar because rain is described as singing and murmuring, just like music, and both create beautiful sounds that can be soothing and melodic.</span></h4><h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><br /></span></h4><h4>e. How are the clouds formed?</h4><h4><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Answer: Clouds are formed when warm air rises and cools, causing the water vapor in the air to condense into tiny water droplets, which then gather together to form clouds.</span></h4><h4><br /></h4> <h4>f. List the pairs of opposite words in the poem.</h4> <p>rise/descend</p> <p>rain/draught</p> <p>day/night</p> <p>reck'd/unreck'd (recked/unrecked)</p><p><br /></p> <h3>C. Why do water and vegetable oil not mix?&nbsp;</h3> <p>Water and oil don't mix well because they're very different.</p><p>Water molecules stick to each other because one part of the molecule is slightly positive and the other part is slightly negative. These opposite parts attract each other, making water sticky.&nbsp;</p><p>Oil molecules don't have positive and negative parts, so they're not sticky like water. Oil molecules just slide past each other.</p><p>Because water and oil molecules interact with each other so differently, they don't mix well.

The writer became disappointed while having fermented horse milk in Mongolia which was really bad.</p> <p>d. The writer's impression of Japanese food is favourable (not mentioned in the text).</p> <p>e. Many people think of jellyfish as scary ones which the Chinese turn into food.</p> <p>f.

Why does food become a challenge for people when they travel?</b></div><div>Answer: Food becomes a challenge when people travel because they encounter new and unusual dishes that they may not be familiar with or have never tried before.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>b. How is haggis prepared?</b></div><div>Answer: Haggis is prepared by taking parts of a sheep like the heart, liver, and lungs, grinding them up, mixing them with mutton fat, oatmeal, and spices, and then packing the mixture in a sheep's stomach. It is boiled for a few hours.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>c.

Give reasons.</h3> <p>I find \"Shiokara\" the strangest of all. Shiokara is a type of food that some people find strange and hard to eat. The use of fermented seafood viscera as the main ingredient, combined with its unusual salty-acidic-ammonia flavor profile, slimy-gelatinous texture, strong odor and role as a condiment rather than main course make shiokara a strange and challenging culinary experience for many people. However, for Japanese people accustomed to the dish, shiokara is a delicious and satisfying fermented delicacy.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Grammar I</h2> <h3>A.

Did Shah spend a normal childhood? Why?</b></div><div>Answer: No, Shah did not spend a normal childhood. His father passed away when he was five years old, and he started working at a young age to support his family.

What have you learned from the life story of Santosh Shah?</b></div><div>Answer: From Santosh Shah's life story, we learn the importance of hard work, continuous learning, and taking risks.

Chef Shah cooked many dishes in the competition. If you were one of the judges in the competition, which food would you ask him to cook? Why?</h3><p>As one of the judges in the competition, I would ask Chef Shah to cook \"Momos.\" Momos are a popular and iconic Nepalese dish that represents the rich and diverse flavors of Nepali cuisine. They are a crowd favorite and are known for their delicious taste and unique fillings, often including vegetables or meat.</p><p>Momos have gained popularity beyond Nepal and are loved by people from various cultures, making them an excellent choice to introduce Nepali food to a wider audience.</p><p>By asking Chef Shah to cook Momos, I would be giving him the opportunity to demonstrate his expertise and creativity while celebrating the essence of Nepali cuisine and its ability to appeal to people from different backgrounds.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Grammar II</h2> <h3>A.

It sounds like an easy question: she (is having) a good time with friends and she (feels )good after a good shot. But psychologists often argue about this question. Some believe that smiling is an individual act: we smile because we feel happy unless we (try ) to hide our emotions. Others claim that we smile to build social relationships. Some animals use a grin to show that they (will not) fight, for example. Perhaps our smile serves the same function. So, who's right? In one study, researchers filmed people bowling. If you watch people doing a very social activity like this, it looks as if they always (smile). They stop smiling only when they (concentrate) on their next shot. But when do they start smiling again? After each good shot, the researchers took photographs to identify when the smile starts — while the player( is still looking) down the alley or a few seconds later when they turn round to share their happiness with the group.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Writing II</h2><p>For Notes, Books, PDFs, Model Questions and Solutions :</p><p>1.

While fast food is convenient and offers variety, it is often high in calories, fat and salt with few nutrients. This can lead to health issues over time.

Why did they return without meeting Anuja's friend?</b></p><p>Answer: The shocking news for her father was when Anuja revealed that she chatted with her friend pretending to be a boy.

Why didn't they talk to each other?</b></p><p>Answer: The girl's mother saw Anuja's father as an \"old man with a big stomach and a bald head\" lurking around the meeting place. They didn't talk to each other because the mother likely misunderstood the situation and thought the father was a stranger with ill intentions.</p><p><br /></p> <h3>D. What can be the consequences of faking your identities and bullying other people on social media and the internet?</h3> <p>Potential consequences of faking identities and cyberbullying others online:</p><p>• Legal consequences - Fines, jail time or other legal penalties if what you're doing is against the law.</p><p>• Reputational damage - Seriously damaging your reputation with friends, family, coworkers and future employers. Difficulty rebuilding trust.</p><p>• Loss of online accounts - Social media accounts can be suspended or deleted for violating terms of service.</p><p>• Retaliation from victims - Victims may seek revenge through counter bullying, spreading rumors, doxing or other means.</p><p>• Less safe online communities - Makes the internet and social media a less safe space, especially for vulnerable groups like children.</p><p>• Negative mental health effects - Can cause feelings of guilt, shame, anxiety and depression over time.</p><p>• Psychological harm to victims - Can cause psychological distress, low self-esteem, anxiety, depression and even suicidal thoughts in victims.</p><p>Instead, it's best to interact with others online in an honest, kind and respectful manner to avoid these potentially serious consequences.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Grammar I</h2> <h3>B.

Share your experiences in the class.</h3><div><div>Hey everyone, I want to share a scary experience I had on December 16, 2021. I was using my computer when suddenly, I saw some weird scripts running on command prompt in my computer screen . I checked and found out that my computer got infected with malware or ransomware.</div><div><br /></div><div>Soon after, I realized my Google Account was hacked, and I couldn't access my YouTube Channel - \"The SR Zone\" which had 41k subscribers that time, website, Facebook, or Instagram accounts. It was devastating to lose control over my online presence.</div><div><br /></div><div>I tried resetting my password, but it didn't work. The hacker seemed to have changed all my login details. I even noticed that the hacker changed the name and icon of my YouTube channel.</div><div><br /></div><div><div>To add to my worries, my YouTube channel got terminated by the hacker. It was devastating to see all my hard work gone in seconds.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>After one sleepless night, I contacted youtube technical support team, with the help of whom I managed to regain control of my Gmail account, but my YouTube channel remained hacked. It was frustrating to deal with this situation. Then, unexpectedly, I got hacked again the next day, because malware was not completely removed from my system. I realized all my files were locked by ransomware this time, and it was terrifying to know that someone had control over my personal data.</div><div><br /></div><div>I learned that viruses can steal your data, and it's crucial to keep our devices protected with strong passwords and security software.</div><div><br /></div><div>I want to remind everyone to be cautious online and take measures to protect your accounts and data. It's essential to use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication to prevent such incidents from happening.</div><div><br /></div><div>Thankfully, I could recover my accounts, but it was a stressful experience. Let's all stay safe online and help each other in maintaining our cybersecurity.</div></div><div><br /></div> <h2>Grammar II</h2> <p>A. Complete the sentences below with articles a or an.</p> <p>a.

      "reward" : "<h2>Writing II</h2> <h3>Write a newspaper article on \"Internet and Cyber Security\". Use the following guidelines in your article.</h3> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">Internet and Cyber Security</p> <p>By Shiva</p> <p>March 7, Kathmandu, Kantipur Post</p> <p>In the modern era, the internet and technology have become an integral part of our daily lives. With the Internet and cyber security threats are increasing.</p><p>The Internet has changed the way we live and work by linking billions of people worldwide and allowing previously unimaginable advancements. However, with the many advantages of Internet access and the proliferation of networked devices come new hazards and threats to cyber security. Cyber thieves and nation-state hackers, according to experts, have gotten more adept and aggressive in recent years.</p><p>Phishing schemes, virus attacks, identity theft, and data breaches are among the most frequent risks. Phishing efforts use convincing-looking emails to deceive unsuspecting users into exposing personal information or downloading dangerous software. Malware, which includes viruses, worms, and ransomware, may silently attack computers, encrypt important information, and move across networks. Identity theft has increased dramatically as hackers steal bank account and Social Security information in order to conduct fraud. Furthermore, significant data breaches at firms and government organizations have exposed the sensitive details of millions of people.</p><p>Because of their less advanced security systems and procedures, small firms are more susceptible to cyber assaults. However, even huge organizations such as hospitals, government institutions, and Fortune 500 firms have experienced disruptive cyberattacks that may cost millions of dollars to repair. Critical infrastructure, such as electricity grids and water treatment facilities, is also becoming more vulnerable as more systems link to the Internet.</p><p>Experts recommend utilizing multi-factor authentication, routinely upgrading software, teaching personnel on security practices, backing up data, deploying malware protection, and establishing firewalls to guard against cyber attacks. However, there is no infallible solution, and both the commercial and governmental sectors must do more to harden security systems, exchange threat intelligence, and hold bad actors responsible in order to discourage future assaults. Internet users must be attentive and informed on how to reduce hazards online until solid security measures are widely deployed.</p><p>The benefits of Internet access cannot be emphasized. However, guaranteeing cyber security and personal data protection must become a greater priority for governments, businesses, and individual users if we are to realize the full advantages of our networked world without losing critical trust, privacy, and creativity.</p><div><br /></div><div>"

Write an essay on your hobbies explaining how they might influence your career.</h3> <p>Title: My Hobby</p> <p>From a young age, I have always had a strong interest in art, writing stories, and solving puzzles. These hobbies have brought me joy and a sense of fulfillment over the years, and I believe they point towards possible career directions for me in the future.</p><p>Art has been my main hobby since childhood. I enjoy drawing, painting and making crafts using different media. I appreciate art for its ability to evoke emotions, convey ideas and capture beautiful moments. My parents have always supported my artistic talents and hung my paintings up in the house. As I get older, I find myself spending more time exploring different art forms and techniques. I believe my passion and natural proclivity for art may lead me towards a career in some form of design or visual creativity. I could see myself pursuing graphic design, web design, illustration or even fine art as a profession in the future.</p><p>Writing stories and poems has also been a constant outlet for my creativity and imagination. I come up with plots, characters and worlds entirely in my head and put them down on paper. The writing process itself is therapy for me - a way to exercise my mind and express my thoughts. My desire to continuously improve my writing skills and tell meaningful stories may point towards possible career paths involving writing, communication or content creation. I would enjoy a career that allows me to regularly flex my creative writing muscles.</p><p>Finally, my enjoyment of puzzles and problems that require logical thought could lead me to pursue a more intellectually challenging career. I find joy in solving mysteries, deciphering codes and engaging in analytical reasoning. This aptitude may be suited to a profession involving research, analysis, problem-solving or critical thinking.</p><p>In summary, my key hobbies of art, writing and puzzles indicate that I have creative, communicative and logical skills that could translate into a variety of careers requiring those abilities. As I get older and my interests evolve, I believe paying close attention to my hobbies will continue to provide valuable insight into potential professions that are well-aligned with my passions and strengths.</p> <p><br /></p>"

It tells the story of a speaker who is trying to climb an apple tree in order to see the town beyond, but is having difficulty reaching the top. However, the speaker remains determined to climb the tree and reach their goal.</p><p>The full poem is only 8 lines long. It depicts the speaker's repeated attempts to climb the tree, and their refusal to give up despite not yet succeeding:</p><p><i>I have climbed the apple tree</i></p><p><i>And trod the limb,</i></p><p><i>Again and again</i></p><p><i>Only to fall back to the green grass below.</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>Yet I still climb the apple tree,</i></p><p><i>For today I shall surely get</i></p><p><i>To the shining town</i></p><p>That dwells on a branch above.</p><p>The repetition of \"I have climbed the apple tree\" and \"Yet I still climb the apple tree\" shows the speaker's persistence and refusal to give up, even after multiple failures. The determination to reach \"the shining town\" on the branch represents the speaker's goal and ambition, which spurs them to keep trying.</p><p>In the end, the short yet powerful poem demonstrates that determination, persistence and refusal to accept failure can help one achieve their objectives, even if it requires multiple attempts. The simple act of climbing an apple tree becomes a metaphor for the challenges we face and overcome in life through grit and resolve.</p><p>So in summary, Amy Lowell's \"Climbing\" uses the image of climbing an apple tree to convey an important message about the value of persistence and determination in the face of obstacles, both literal and metaphorical.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Exercise</h2> <h3>A.

Write a couple of paragraphs about Nepal's journey from Panchayat to Multiparty Democracy.</h3><p>Nepal's transition from an autocratic Panchayat system to a multiparty democracy was a lengthy process spanning nearly 30 years. It began with King Mahendra's seizure of power in 2017 B.S. and culminated in 2046 B.S. with the legalization of political parties and restoration of democracy in response to years of public demand and nonviolent protest movements.</p><p>King Mahendra dismissed the elected government in 2017 B.S., banned political parties and seized power to establish an autocratic Panchayat system. This one-party system ruled Nepal for over 20 years, concentrating power in the monarchy.</p><p>However, demands for democracy and multi-party politics began to grow. In 2036, a referendum was announced to gauge public support for reform. The referendum in 2037 showed strong support for a transition to a multiparty system.</p><p>This led to a nonviolent civil disobedience movement in 2042 and a mass pro-democracy movement in 2046 that spread across the country. As protests intensified, pressure mounted on the king to restore democracy.</p><p>Finally, on 26th Chaitra 2046 B.S., King Birendra announced the restoration of a multi-party democratic system in Nepal, officially ending the Panchayat era. For the first time in decades, political parties were legalized and elections promised.</p><p>In summary, these events marked a turning point in Nepal's history towards a more democratic form of governance.</p><p><br /></p> <p><b>B. Some people think studying history is just a waste of time while others think that it is essential. What do you think of these ideas? Write your opinion in about 200 words.</b></p> <p>I believe studying history is far from a waste of time. In fact, it is essential for many reasons.</p><p>History provides important context and insight for understanding the present. So many current events, social issues, political structures and conflicts have roots in the past. Studying history helps us see how we arrived at where we are today. Without this perspective, we can't fully comprehend the present.</p><p>History teaches valuable lessons that we can apply to our own times. We learn from the successes and failures of those who came before us. History is filled with examples of the consequences of certain ideologies, policies and actions that can inform our own choices today. Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.</p><p>History cultivates important thinking skills like analysis, interpretation and critical thinking. Studying history requires analyzing evidence, interpreting motives and events from different perspectives, and thinking critically about biases and gaps in historical sources. These skills transfer to many other areas of life.</p><p>History helps develop empathy, cultural awareness and global citizenship. Studying how people from different times and cultures lived helps us better understand the diversity of human experience and cultivates empathy, tolerance and broader perspectives. This makes us more global citizens.</p><p>In summary, studying history provides context, teaches lessons, develops important skills and cultivates broader perspectives that carry value for our lives today. While history may not seem immediately relevant, its indirect benefits make it essential to a well-rounded education and fully informed citizenship. Simply put, we need to understand the past to navigate the present and future with wisdom.</p><p><br /></p>"

The owl slowly opened one eye and saw the grasshopper happily chirping away on a branch nearby.</p><p>\"What joyful singing!\" the owl said. \"Tell me young grasshopper, what are you so happy about on this fine day?\"</p><p>\"I sing for the sheer pleasure of it.\" replied the grasshopper. \"The hot sun warms my back and the breeze rustles the leaves, making the sweetest music for me to dance to.\"</p><p>The owl chuckled. \"Dear grasshopper, you have plenty of time now for singing and dancing in the sun. But do you also think of preparing for winter when the cold winds will whistle and your food will become scarce?\"</p><p>The grasshopper laughed. \"Why think of winter when we have this glorious summer day? I will enjoy it to the full and let the future take care of itself!\"</p><p>The owl shook his head sadly. \"Alas, short-sighted creature. Your song now may turn to sorrow later if you fail to prepare.\" But the grasshopper paid the owl no heed and soon resumed his chirping.</p><p>As the warm afternoon turned to evening, the owl closed his eyes once more, hoping the silly grasshopper's carefree song would teach him a lesson when winter finally came.</p> <p><br /></p>"

      "reward" : "<h2>Writing I</h2> <h3>You might have read or heard some moral stories. Write your favourite one in your own words.</h3> <p>Title : The Ant and the Grasshopper</p> <p>Once there was an ant who lived in a large anthill. One day while marching to collect food, the ant noticed a tiny grasshopper sitting in the grass.</p><p>\"How do you pass your time?\" the ant asked.</p><p>\"I sing and dance all day,\" replied the grasshopper. \"Why should I bother collecting food when it's such beautiful weather?\"</p><p>The ant tried to advise the grasshopper to store up food for the winter, but the grasshopper just laughed and continued singing.</p><p>When winter came, the ant's anthill was filled with grain. The ant spent the cold days resting and enjoying its storage. But the grasshopper found itself starving with no food. With nothing to eat, it soon perished in the harsh winter.</p><p>The moral of the story is that preparation for the future is important. Those who work hard and store up for the difficult times will be rewarded, while those who consume everything in the present may suffer in the future. The story teaches the value of planning ahead, saving for the long run, and not taking today for granted. While singing and dancing may bring joy now, working to secure our basic needs ensures happiness in the long term.</p><p>This simple story has stayed with me because it captures an important life lesson in a memorable way. The contrast between the industrious ant and carefree grasshopper illustrates how different attitudes impact our future wellbeing. The story's moral about the value of preparation over instant gratification provides a lesson that applies not just to children, but to adults as well.</p> <p><br /></p>"

Nepali Student Migration</h4><p>This graph shows how many Nepali students went to study in other countries from 2009 to 2019. In 2009/2010, 26,948 Nepali students went to study abroad. The next year, in 2010/2011, only 11,912 students went. But after that, more and more Nepali students went to study abroad each year.</p><p>There were a few years where the number of students went down slightly, but mostly the numbers went up. In 2016/2017, there was a big jump in the number of Nepali students studying abroad, with 50,659 students. After that, even more Nepali students went abroad to study.</p><p>Overall, this graph shows that more Nepali students are interested in studying in other countries and are taking advantage of opportunities to do so.</p><p><br /></p><h4>b. Distribution of Population of Kathmandu Metropolitan in Terms of Languages (Based on the population census of 2011.</h4><p>The pie chart shows the distribution of the population of Kathmandu Metropolitan based on the language they speak, according to the 2011 census data.</p><p>The key insight from the chart is that while Nepali is the dominant language spoken in Kathmandu, there is significant linguistic diversity with several other languages spoken by sizeable populations.</p><p>Nepali is the largest segment, making up 57% of the population. This indicates that Nepali is the main language used in Kathmandu.</p><p>Newari, spoken by 18.5% of the population, is the second most common language. This reflects the historical importance of Newar culture in the Kathmandu Valley.</p><p>Tamang and Maithili each make up around 5% of the population, showing that ethnic Tamang and Maithili communities also have a notable presence in Kathmandu.</p><p>Hindi and Bhojpuri, likely due to cultural and historical ties with India, together constitute around 3.5% of the population.</p><p>The remaining 9.5% encompasses speakers of \"Other\" languages, indicating a fair degree of linguistic diversity beyond the main languages shown.</p><p>In summary, the chart reveals that while Nepali is overwhelmingly dominant in Kathmandu, other languages collectively spoken by over 40% of the population point to the region's rich cultural and ethnic diversity stemming from its multiethnic population.</p><p><br /></p>"

      "reward" : "<h2>Writing II</h2><h3>Write an essay on 'The Impacts of Migration'</h3><div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><u><b>The Impacts of Migration</b></u></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><br /></div><div>Migration, the movement of people from one place to another, has been a constant phenomenon throughout human history. While migration often arises due to push factors like conflict, poverty and persecution, it also reflects pull factors like desire for better opportunities and quality of life. Regardless of its causes, migration impacts both sending and receiving nations in complex economic, social, political and environmental ways.</div><div><br /></div><div>One of the most significant impacts of migration is economic. Migrant workers contribute to the economies of recipient nations through their labor, skills, taxes and spending power. They fill demand for low-skill and high-skill jobs that native citizens often shun. However, migration can also strain social services and drive down wages for native low-skill workers. For sending countries, remittances from migrants bring in foreign currency that contributes substantially to the national economy. However, \"brain drain\" of highly skilled workers limits human capital development.</div><div><br /></div><div>Socially, migration influences the demographics, cultures and identities of both sending and recipient nations. Migration diversifies the population and enriches the culture of recipient nations through food, art, language and religion. However, tensions can arise if integration policies are insufficient or native populations resist cultural change. For migrant communities, transnational ties and cultural preservation efforts help maintain identities across generations.</div><div><br /></div><div>Politically, mass migration can influence voter demographics, favoring some political interests over others. It also provokes debates over immigration policy and national identity. In recent decades, some nations have adopted more restrictive policies while others maintain relatively open immigration systems.</div><div><br /></div><div>In summary, while migration brings economic benefits through labor and skills, it also introduces social and political challenges related to integration, identity and resource allocation. A balanced, humane and evidence-based approach is needed to maximize the opportunities of migration while minimizing its disruptive impacts. With good will and sound policies on all sides, migration can indeed become a engine for progress, cultural exchange and global understanding.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>"

We had been talking about booking a tropical vacation for months, and once we finally made the decision we hastily arranged everything within a week!</p><p>We flew almost 9 hours from Kathmandu to Male, and then took a short 40 minute speedboat ride to our resort on Coral Bay island. The turquoise blue water and white sandy beaches straight out of a postcard came into view as we approached.</p><p>Our main purpose for this trip was simply to relax, recharge our batteries and spend some carefree time together. And that's exactly what we did! We spent countless hours lounging by the beach, swimming in the crystal clear lagoon and enjoying many seafood lunches right on the shore.</p><p>One of the most memorable experiences was snorkeling among the beautiful corals and an amazing array of colorful fish just a short swim from our resort. We even spotted a moray eel peering out of its den! Observing the underwater world up close was magical.</p><p>Looking back, I feel this trip helped me realize how important it is to slow down once in a while, appreciate the simple pleasures in life and cherish the time I have with my loved ones.

      "story" : "<h2>Unit 14 - Reading II : Weather </h2> <p>Thomas Hardy's poem 'Weather' portrays the contrasting preferences for weather by two different individuals: the cuckoo and the speaker. The cuckoo enjoys the weather characterized by showers, chestnut spikes, and the singing of the nightingale. The scene is described as maids come forth dressed in muslin and citizens dream of the south and west. The speaker also expresses their liking for this weather.</p><p>On the other hand, the shepherd avoids a different weather setting. The description includes beech trees dripping in browns and duns, with hillsides pulsating with tides and meadow rivulets overflowing. Rooks return to their homes, indicating a time of heavy rain or storm. The speaker also aligns with the shepherd's dislike for this weather.</p><p>Overall, the poem emphasizes individual preferences and highlights the diversity of experiences and feelings that different weather conditions evoke in people and animals alike.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Weather Exercise Grade 10</h2><div><br /></div><div><div>Written by The SR Zone | Shriram Lamichhane</div><div><br /></div></div> <p><b>A.

Does the poet enjoy the winter or the spring? Why?</b></div><div>Answer: The poet enjoys the spring because the weather described in the poem is the one he likes.</div></div><div><br /></div> <h3>C. Complete the interpretation of the poem using suitable words or phrases given below.</h3> <p>[chestnut, young girls, south and west, Thomas Hardy, severity sunny, beeches, rooks, hang]</p> <p>The poem 'Weathers' was composed by an English poet, Thomas Hardy, who talks about two different seasons which are the spring and the winter. In the first stanza, the pleasant spring season is described. Cuckoo and Nightingale feel good in this season. The light rain flows over the pointed leaves of the chestnut tree.</p> <p>The poet is pleased as the nightingale sings at his best tune. People come out of their houses to enjoy the weather and the birds' song. The young girls are seen in their fine clothes. The people plan to visit different places in the south and west. To an English person, the south and the west are associated with summer holiday destinations, where the weather at that time is often warm and sunny, and many coastal towns provide welcoming accommodations and amusements. The poet likes this weather as it is liked by all the birds, animals, and humans as well.</p> <p>In the second stanza, he talks about the winter's coldness and severity. All the natural beauty turns into dullness and discomfort. The cuckoo hates this weather. The beeches turn dull and brown as their leaves are threshed by the wind. The water drops hang from the wooden bars of the gates. One can see some streams overflowing as it has been raining a lot. The rooks fly to their homes as the harshness of winter gradually grows. The poet dislikes the winter season because it is very cold and wet.</p> <p>Symbolically the poet tries to state the bright and dark aspects of human life and the word 'weathers' indicates human life. The spring represents the bright whereas the winter represents the dark aspects of our life.</p><p><br /></p> <h3>D. In which season would you like to travel? Why?</h3> <p>Personally, I would like to travel in the spring season. Spring is a time of renewal and blooming nature. The weather is usually pleasant, with milder temperatures and longer daylight hours. It's a great time to explore outdoor destinations, witness beautiful landscapes, and enjoy the colorful display of flowers in full bloom. Additionally, many places are less crowded during spring compared to peak tourist seasons, allowing for a more peaceful and enjoyable travel experience. Overall, spring offers a perfect balance of comfortable weather and natural beauty, making it an ideal season for travel and exploration.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Grammar II</h2> <h3>A.

Here is his life story:</p><p>My uncle's name is Gaurav. He was born into a lower middle class family and had to work various jobs throughout his schooling to support his family. Despite the financial difficulties, he always did well in his studies and dreamed of becoming an engineer.</p><p>After he finished high school, my uncle obtained a scholarship to study Mechanical Engineering at a reputed university. He graduated at the top of his class and was offered a job at a multinational company. He worked hard and quickly rose through the ranks, earning several promotions in his 20s.</p><p>Throughout his career, my uncle stressed the importance of education to me and my cousins. He financially supported us in any way he could and motivated us to do well in school. He always told us to follow our dreams, no matter how impossible they may seem.</p><p>After 25 years of working for the same company, my uncle decided to start his own business. He quit his job and with his savings, started a small consulting firm. It was a risk, but the business flourished. Today, my uncle's company employs over 50 people and he is able to provide for his entire extended family.</p><p>Whenever I feel discouraged or want to give up, I think of my uncle's journey from humble beginnings to great success. His life story inspires me to work hard, be persistent and take risks to achieve my goals. He taught me that with determination and faith in oneself, any dream is possible. I aspire to have even a fraction of his courage, generosity and wisdom as I make my own way in the world.</p><p>My uncle's life story reminds me that true inspiration often comes from ordinary people who rise to extraordinary heights through grit and hard work. I am fortunate to have him as an inspirational figure and role model in my life.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Grammar I</h2> <h3>A. Choose the correct prepositions and complete the sentences.</h3> <p>a.

It gives guidance on how to lead a good and noble life.</p><p>The poem starts by telling the son that if he can remain calm and keep his composure in both victory and defeat, he will be a truly strong man. It says if he can treat triumphs and tragedies just as two impostors, he will find true worth.</p><p>It tells the son that if he can trust himself when others doubt him and maintain his ideals when they seem unpopular, he will remain on the right path. It says if he can bear success with humility and failure without bitterness, he will find true inner peace.</p><p>The poem says if the son can make friends with those who are unlike him and retain his compassion for all, he will be a worthy friend. It tells him that if he can fill his life with work hard and meaningful work, not worrying about reward, he will find true happiness.</p><p>In the end, the poem says if the son can dream big dreams but lose them without regrets and understand simple joys and yoke of service, he will be a true man and true gentleman. The final lines tell him that the entire world will be his if he can make these things his standard of the man.</p><p>In summary, the poem offers wise advice about how to build character and lead a good life - through composure, integrity, humility, compassion, hard work and service above self. If the son can follow this standard, he will truly become the man he ought to be.</p><p><br /></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>IF Poem Exercise</b></h2><p><b>A.

Complete the summary of the poem using the given words/ phrases.</b></p><p>[will importance, success, failure value, inspirational, truthfulness, virtue]</p><p>In 'If', Rudyard Kipling provides inspirational insights into life. In the first stanza, the poet suggests us to keep calm, have self- trust and bear failure. According to the poet, it is important to be thoughtful about an action before undertaking it. Similarly, balancing between success and failure is another important quality of a successful person. In the third stanza, the poet suggests us to value our winnings. We must devote our intellect, heart, and muscle in the work we do, and we should always have a strong virtue to achieve success. In the final stanza, the poet suggests us to maintain our truthfulness no matter who we are with. Most importantly, we must realize the importance of time.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>C. Answer the following questions.</b></p><p><b>a. What does the poet suggest about dealing with lies?</b></p><p>Answer: The poet suggests not being affected by lies or dishonesty and maintaining integrity.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>b. What do you mean by 'not be tired by waiting'?</b></p><p>Answer: \"Not be tired by waiting\" means being patient and persistent in pursuing goals and dreams.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>c. Why should we not aim only to dream in life?</b></p><p>Answer: We should not aim only to dream in life because dreams alone are not enough to achieve success. Practical actions and hard work are necessary to turn dreams into reality.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>d. How do you think we can achieve our dream?</b></p><p>Answer: To achieve our dreams, we need to stay focused, work hard, maintain composure in both success and failure, and trust ourselves even when others doubt us.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>e.

However, we should not let their actions affect our character or moral values.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>f. Why should we forget our failures in life?</b></p><p>Answer: We should forget our failures in life to avoid dwelling on past disappointments. Instead, we should learn from our mistakes, maintain composure, and move forward with a positive mindset.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>g. What should we do if we lose the 'pitch-and-toss'?</b></p><p>Answer: If we lose the 'pitch-and-toss,' representing a game of chance or luck, we should not brood over the loss. Instead, we should treat both winning and losing with equanimity and maintain inner peace and composure.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>D. What suggestions do your parents and teachers give you to be successful in life?</b></p><p>Here are the main suggestions my parents and teachers give for me to be successful in life:</p><p>• Get a good education. They stress studying hard and getting a college degree from a reputed institution.</p><p>• Develop good habits and skills. They say to build habits like discipline, time management and communication skills.</p><p>• Work hard and be persistent. They encourage sustaining effort and persistence in the face of challenges.</p><p>• Stay focused on goals. They advise setting goals, making plans to achieve them and reviewing progress regularly.</p><p>• Build strong character. They emphasize values like honesty, integrity, humility and empathy as the basis for success.</p><p>In summary, education, hard work, persistence, goal-focusedness and strong character are the core advice I receive from my parents and teachers to achieve success.</p><p><br /></p><p><b>Grammar II</b></p><p><b>Complete the sentences below with the correct prepositional phrases from the box.</b></p><p>[in cash, at playing, interested in, with each other, out of their hand, in a hurry, out of reach, on a diet, at large, on board of the situation]</p><p>a.

We should rather take our failures as an opportunity to correct our mistakes and achieve success next time. Draft a speech on ‘Failure as Pillar of Success’. Include relevant examples from renowned and successful personalities in the world.</b></h3> <p>Answer:&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\">Speech on Failure as Pillar of Success</p> <p style=\"text-align: left;\">Ladies and gentlemen,</p> <p>Good morning everyone. The topic I would like to speak about today is 'Failure as Pillar of Success'.</p><p>We all fail at some point in our lives. Failure can be discouraging and make us want to give up. But failure, if viewed rightly, can become the stepping stone to success. Every failure contains within it the seed of an equivalent advantage.</p><p>Thomas Edison failed countless times while trying to create the light bulb. But he did not give up. He said \"I have not failed, I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.\" His perseverance through failure eventually led to the invention that changed the world.</p><p>Walt Disney was fired from his first job at a newspaper for \"not being creative.\" He then failed several times trying to start his own business before finally finding success with Mickey Mouse and Disneyland. His failures helped him develop the grit and determination to eventually turn his dreams into reality.</p><p>J.K. Rowling was rejected by dozens of publishers before finally publishing the first Harry Potter book. Now she is one of the most successful authors of all time. Her failures merely delayed, but could not stop, her eventual success.</p><p>These examples show us that failure is inevitable for those who aim high. But how we respond to failure determines our success. We must learn from our failures, find areas for improvement, and try again with new insight and renewed motivation. Failure truly is the pillar upon which success is built. So the next time you fail, remember that failure is just a stepping stone, use it to take one step closer to your dreams.</p><p>Thank you.</p> <p><br /></p>"

The city oozes culture and history.</p><p>• Food: The French capital has a far more diverse and globally renowned culinary scene with its wide variety of cuisine, fine dining restaurants and cafes. Parisian food is more appealing to me.</p><p>• Style: Paris is known for its style, fashion and flair. The city greatly influences global design trends. I would enjoy the stylish vibe of Paris.</p><p>• Atmosphere: The more laid-back atmosphere, café culture and charm of Paris appeals to me more than London's busyness and hustle. I prefer the ambiance of the French capital.</p><p>In short, Paris' rich culture and heritage, superior cuisine, stylish flair, more relaxed atmosphere and overall appeal make it my preferred city over London for a tourist visit. The all-round experience of Paris intrigues me far more.</p><p><br /></p> <h2>Grammar I</h2> <p><b>A. Choose the correct adjective or adverb to complete the following sentences.</b></p> <p>a.

      "reward" : "<h2>Writing I</h2> <h3>Write a couple of paragraphs comparing our capital city, Kathmandu with any other city in Nepal.</h3> <p>Kathmandu is Nepal's capital city and is often compared to other cities in the nation. Pokhara, situated in western Nepal, is one such city that is often compared to Kathmandu. While both cities have distinct charms, there are also significant contrasts between them.</p><p>Kathmandu is a vibrant city with a diverse cultural history. Several UNESCO World Heritage Sites are located here, including Durbar Square, Swayambhunath, and Pashupatinath. The city is also noted for its colorful street life, with tiny lanes and bazaars crowded with stores offering everything from traditional handicrafts to cutting-edge technology. The city has a rich history and is a melting pot of many cultures and customs, making it an intriguing diverse destination.</p><p>Pokhara, on the other hand, is a more relaxed city noted for its magnificent natural beauty. The settlement is situated on the banks of Phewa Lake, surrounded by the magnificent Annapurna mountain range. It's a famous spot for adventure sports including hiking, paragliding, and white water rafting. There are also various temples and monasteries worth seeing in the city.</p><p>While both Kathmandu and Pokhara have their own distinct charms, they provide tourists with completely different experiences. Kathmandu is a busy metropolis rich in history and culture, but Pokhara is a more peaceful city surrounded by natural beauty and offering a variety of adventure activities. Finally, the decision between the two cities will be determined by the sort of experience that tourists want.</p> <p><br /></p> <h2>Reading II&nbsp;</h2><h2>The Country Mouse and the City Mouse Poem Summary</h2> <p>The Country Mouse and the City Mouse poem. It is a classic fable written by Aesop. The poem tells the story of two mice, one who lives in the country and another who lives in the city.</p><p>The City Mouse invites the Country Mouse to visit him in the city where he lives a luxurious life. The Country Mouse visits and is amazed by all the wonderful food and comforts in the city home. However, during the feast, the house suddenly shakes as human beings enter, frightening the Country Mouse who quickly flees back to his simple but safe country home.</p><p>The moral of the poem is that what appears luxurious and desirable from the outside may actually hide dangers and discomfort. Simple pleasures and a safe environment are often preferable to an ostentatious lifestyle. Contentment comes from within, rather than from material comforts.</p><p>The poem highlights the contrast between country and city life - the simple but safe comforts of the country versus the exciting but perilous pleasures of the city. It ultimately recommends moderation and contentment with what one has rather than pursuing lavishness at the cost of peace of mind.</p><p>In short, the poem uses the mice's experiences to convey the message that what is sufficient to provide for one's needs is better than an extravagant life full of risks and anxiety. Simplicity, safety and contentment should be valued over luxury and superficial pleasures.</p><p><br /></p>"

      "reward" : "<h2>Writing II</h2> <p><b>Many people believe that social networking sites such as Facebook and TikTok have negative impacts on both individuals and society while others believe that they have connected people globally. What do you think? Write an essay expressing your on the impacts of social media.</b></p> <div style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Impacts of Social Media</b></div> <p>Social networking sites have become an integral part of our daily lives. While offering many benefits of connecting people across the globe, they also pose risks for individuals and society. In my opinion, the positive and negative impacts of social media are both considerable. It depends on how users utilize these platforms responsibly.</p><p>On the positive side, social media enables people to stay connected with ease. Family and friends who live far away can interact online every day. Social media also allows users to make new connections based on shared interests and experiences. This expansion of social circles can combat isolation and loneliness. Furthermore, social media platforms have become effective tools for spreading ideas and raising awareness about social causes. Movements and campaigns on issues like human rights, environmental protection and public health have gained momentum through social networking.</p><p>However, excessive use of social media can be harmful. It can lead to addiction, where people become preoccupied with checking updates and feel compelled to post constantly to gain approval. This can damage real-life relationships and reduce productivity. Furthermore, the flood of information on social media makes it difficult to distinguish facts from rumors and propaganda. This threatens our ability to think critically. Social media can also have negative impacts on mental health and wellbeing, especially among younger users. Issues like depression, anxiety, body image issues and cyberbullying have been linked to the overuse of such sites.</p><p>In conclusion, while social media offers numerous benefits in terms of connecting people and spreading awareness, it also poses risks if used irresponsibly. The key is to practice self-control and moderation in our use of these platforms. With awareness of its impacts and a balanced approach, social media can enrich our lives while minimizing potential harm. The onus is on individuals, families and communities to utilize these technologies wisely for positive change.</p> <p><br /></p><p>Thank You !&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>"
